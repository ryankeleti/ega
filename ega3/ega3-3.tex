\label{subsection:devissage-lemma}

\begin{defn}[3.1.1]
\label{3.3.1.1}
Let $\C$ be an abelian category.
We say that a subset $\C'$ of the set of objects of $\C$ is \emph{exact} if $0\in\C'$ and if, for every exact sequence $0\to A'\to A\to A''\to 0$ in $\C$ such that two of the objects $A$, $A'$, $A''$ are in $\C'$, then the third is also in $\C'$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[3.1.2]
\label{3.3.1.2}
Let $X$ be a Noetherian prescheme; we denote by $\C$ the abelian category of coherent $\OO_X$-modules.
Let $\C'$ be an exact subset of $\C$, $X'$ a closed subset of the underlying space of $X$.
Suppose that for every closed irreducible subset $Y$ of $X'$, with generic point $y$, there exists a $\OO_X$-module $\sh{G}\in\C'$ such that $\sh{G}_y$ is a $\kres(y)$-vector space of dimension~$1$.
Then every coheren $\OO_X$-module with support contained in $X'$ is in $\C'$ (and in particular, if $X'=X$, then we have $\C'=\C$).
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-3.3.1.2}
Consider the following property $\textbf{P}(Y)$ of a closed subset $Y$ of $X'$: every coherent $\OO_X$-module with support contained in $Y$ is in $\C'$.
By virtue of the principle of Noetherian induction \sref[0]{0.2.2.2}, we see that we can reduce to showing that \emph{if $Y$ is a closed subset of $X'$ such that the property $\textbf{P}(Y')$ is true for every closed subset $Y'$ of $Y$, distinct from $Y$, then $\textbf{P}(Y)$ is true}.

Therefore, let $\sh{F}\in\C$ have support contained in $Y$, and we show that $\sh{F}\in\C'$.
Denote also by $Y$ the reduced closed subprescheme of $X$ having $Y$ for its underlying space \sref[I]{1.5.2.1}; it is defined by a coherent sheaf of ideals $\sh{J}$ of $\OO_X$.
We know \sref[I]{1.9.3.4} that there exists an integer $n>0$ such that $\sh{J}^n\sh{F}=0$; for $1\leq k\leq n$, we thus have an exact sequence
\[
  0\to\sh{J}^{k-1}\sh{F}/\sh{J}^k\sh{F}\to\sh{F}/\sh{J}^k\sh{F}\to\sh{F}/\sh{J}^{k-1}\sh{F}\to 0
\]
 of coherent $\OO_X$-modules (\sref[I]{1.5.3.6} and \sref[I]{1.5.3.3}); as $\C'$ is exact, we see, by induction on $k$, that it suffices to show that each of the $\sh{F}_k=\sh{J}^{k-1}\sh{F}/\sh{J}^k\sh{F}$ is in $\C'$.
We thus reduce to proving that $\sh{F}\in\C'$ under the additional hypothesis that $\sh{J}\sh{F}=0$; it is equivalent to say that $\sh{F}=j_*(j^*(\sh{F}))$, where $j$ is the canonical injection $Y\to X$.
Let us now consider two cases:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item $Y$ is \emph{reducible}.
    Let $Y=Y'\cap Y''$, where $Y'$ and $Y''$ are closed subsets of $Y$, distinct from $Y$; denote also by $Y'$ and $Y''$ the reduced closed subpreschemes of $X$ having $Y$ and $Y''$ for their respective underlying spaces, which are defined respectively by sheaves of ideals $\sh{J}'$ and $\sh{J}''$ of $\OO_X$.
    Set $\sh{F}'=\sh{F}\otimes_{\OO_X}(\OO_X/\sh{J}')$ and $\sh{F}''=\sh{F}\otimes_{\OO_X}(\OO_X/\sh{J}'')$.
    The canonical homomorphisms $\sh{F}\to\sh{F}'$ and $\sh{F}\to\sh{F}''$ thus define a homomorphism $u:\sh{F}\to\sh{F}'\oplus\sh{F}''$.
    We show that for every $z\not\in Y'\cap Y''$, the homomorphism $u_z:\sh{F}_z\to\sh{F}_z'\oplus\sh{F}_z''$ is \emph{bijective}.
    Indeed, we have $\sh{J}'\cap\sh{J}''=\sh{J}$, since the question is local and
\oldpage[III]{116}
    the above equality follows from (\sref[I]{1.5.2.1} and \sref[I]{1.1.1.5}); if $z\not\in Y''$, then we have $\sh{J}_z'=\sh{J}_z$, hence $\sh{F}_z'=\sh{F}_z$ and $\sh{F}_z''=0$, which establishes our assertion in this case; we reason similarly for $z\not\in Y'$.
    As a result, the kernel and cokernel of $u$, which are in $\C$ \sref[0]{0.5.3.4}, have their support in $Y'\cap Y''$, and thus is in $\C'$ by hypothesis; for the same reason, $\sh{F}'$ and $\sh{F}''$ are in $\C'$, hence also $\sh{F}'\oplus\sh{F}''$, as $\C'$ is exact.
    The conclusion then follows from the consideration of the two exact sequences
    \[
      0\to\Im u\to\sh{F}'\oplus\sh{F}''\to\Coker u\to 0,
    \]
    \[
      0\to\Ker u\to\sh{F}\to\Im u\to 0,
    \]
    and the hypothesis that $\C'$ is exact.
  \item $Y$ is irreducible, and as a result, the subprescheme $Y$ of $X$ is \emph{integral}.
    If $y$ is its generic point, then we have $(\OO_Y)_y=\kres(y)$, and as $j^*(\sh{F})$ is a coherent $\OO_Y$-module, $\sh{F}_y=(j^*(\sh{F}))_y$ is a $\kres(y)$-vector space of finite dimension~$m$.
    By hypothesis, there is a coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{G}\in\C'$ (necessarily of support $Y$) such that $\sh{G}_y$ is a $\kres(y)$-vector space of dimension~$1$.
    As a result, there is a $\kres(y)$-isomorphism $(\sh{G}_y)^m\isoto\sh{F}_y$, which is also an $\OO_Y$-isomorphism, and as $\sh{G}^m$ and $\sh{F}$ are coherent, there exists an open neighborhood $W$ of $y$ in $X$ and an isomorphism $\sh{G}^m|W\isoto\sh{F}|W$ \sref[0]{0.5.2.7}.
    Let $\sh{H}$ be the graph of this isomorphism, which is a coherent $(\OO_X|W)$-submodule of $(\sh{G}^m\oplus\sh{F})|W$, canonically isomorphic to $\sh{G}^m|W$ and to $\sh{F}|W$; there thus exists a coherent $\OO_X$-submodule $\sh{H}_0$ of $\sh{G}^m\oplus\sh{F}$, inducing $\sh{H}$ on $W$ and $0$ on $X\setmin Y$, since $\sh{G}^m$ and $\sh{F}$ have $Y$ for their support~\sref[I]{1.9.4.7}.
    The restrictions $v:\sh{H}_0\to\sh{G}^m$ and $w:\sh{H}_0\to\sh{F}$ of the canonical projections of $\sh{G}^m\oplus\sh{F}$ are then homomorphisms of coherent $\OO_X$-modules, which, on $W$ and on $X\setmin Y$, reduce to isomorphisms; in other words, the kernels and cokernels of $v$ and $w$ have their suppoer in the closed set $Y\setmin(Y\cap W)$, distinct from $Y$.
    They are in $\C'$; on the other hand, we have $\sh{G}^m\in\C'$ since $\sh{G}\in\C'$ and since $\C'$ is exact.
    We conclude successively, by the exactness of $\C'$, that $\sh{H}_0\in\C'$, then $\sh{F}\in\C'$.
Q.E.D.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[3.1.3]
\label{3.3.1.3}
Suppose that the exact subset $\C'$ of $\C$ has in addition the property that any coherent direct factor of a coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{M}\in\C'$ is also in $\C'$.
In this case, the conclusion of Theorem~\sref{3.3.1.2} is still valid when the condition ``$\sh{G}_y$ is a $\kres(y)$-vector space of dimension~$1$'' is replaced by $\sh{G}_y\neq 0$ (this is equivalent to $\Supp(\sh{G})=Y$).
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-3.3.1.3}
The reasoning of Theorem~\sref{3.3.1.2} must be modified only in the case~(b); now $\sh{G}_y$ is a $\kres(y)$-vector space of dimension $q>0$, and as a result, we have an $\OO_Y$-isomorphism $(\sh{G}_y)^m\isoto(\sh{F}_y)^q$; the end of the reasoning in Theorem~\sref{3.3.1.2} then proves that $\sh{F}^q\in\C'$, and the additional hypothesis on $\C'$ implies that $\sh{F}\in\C'$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The finiteness theorem: the case of usual schemes}
\label{subsection:finiteness-theorem-usual-case}

\begin{thm}[3.2.1]
\label{3.3.2.1}
Let $Y$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $f:X\to Y$ a proper morphism.
For every coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{F}$, the $\OO_Y$-modules $\RR^q f_*(\sh{F})$ are coherent for $q\geq 0$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-3.3.2.1}
The question being local on $Y$, we can suppose $Y$ Noetherian, thus $X$ Noetherian~\sref[I]{1.6.3.7}.
The coherent $\OO_X$-modules $\sh{F}$ for which the conclusion of Theorem~\sref{3.3.2.1} is true forms an \emph{exact} subset $\C'$ of the category $\C$ of coherent $\OO_X$-modules.
\oldpage[III]{117}
Indeed, let $0\to\sh{F}'\to\sh{F}\to\sh{F}''\to 0$ is an exact sequence of coherent $\OO_X$-modules; suppose for example that $\sh{F}'$ and $\sh{F}''$ belong to $\C'$; we have the long exact sequence in cohomology
\[
  \RR^{q-1}f_*(\sh{F}'')\xrightarrow{\partial}\RR^q f_*(\sh{F}')\to\RR^q f_*(\sh{F})\to\RR^q f_*(\sh{F}'')\xrightarrow{\partial}\RR^{q+1}f_*(\sh{F}'),
\]
in which by hypothesis the outer four terms are coherent; it is the same for the middle term $\RR^q f_*(\sh{F})$ by (\sref[0]{0.5.3.4}~and~\sref[0]{0.5.3.3}).
We show in the same way that when $\sh{F}$ and $\sh{F}'$ (resp.~$\sh{F}$ and $\sh{F}''$) are in $\C'$, then so is $\sh{F}''$ (resp.~$\sh{F}'$).
In addition, every coherent \emph{direct factor} $\sh{F}'$ of an $\OO_X$-module $\sh{F}\in\C'$ belongs to $\C'$: indeed, $\RR^q f_*(\sh{F}')$ is then a direct factor of $\RR^q f_*(\sh{F})$~(G,~II,~4.4.4), therefore it is of finite type, and as it is quasi-coherent~\sref{3.1.4.10}, it is coherent, as $Y$ is Noetherian.
By virtue of Corollary~\sref{3.3.1.3}, we reduce to proving that when $X$ is \emph{irreducible} with generic point $x$, there exists \emph{one} coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{F}$ belonging to $\C'$, such that $\sh{F}_x\neq 0$: indeed, if this point is established, then it can be applied to any irreducible closed subprescheme $Y$ of $X$, since if $j:Y\to X$ is the canonical injection, then $f\circ j$ is proper~\sref[II]{2.5.4.2}, and if $\sh{G}$ is a coherent $\OO_Y$-module with support $Y$, then $j_*(\sh{G})$ is a coherent $\OO_X$-module such that $\RR^q(f\circ j)_*(\sh{G})=\RR^q f_*(j_*(\sh{G}))$~(G,~II,~4.9.1), therefore we can apply COrollary~\sref{3.3.1.3}.

By virtue of Chow's lemma~\sref[II]{2.5.6.2}, there exists an irreducible prescheme $X'$ an a \emph{projective} and surjective morphism $g:X'\to X$ such that $f\circ g:X'\to Y$ is \emph{projective}.
There exists an ample $\OO_X$-module $\sh{L}$ for $g$~\sref[II]{2.5.3.1}; we apply the fundamental theorem of projective morphisms~\sref{3.2.2.1} to $g:X'\to X$ and with $\sh{L}$: there thus exixts an integer $n$ such that $\sh{F}=g_*(\OO_{X'}(n))$ is a coherent $\OO_X$-module and $\RR^q g_*(\OO_{X'}(n))=0$ for all $q>0$; in addition, as $g^*(g_*(\OO_{X'}(n)))\to\OO_{X'}(n)$ is surjective for $n$ large enough~\sref{3.2.2.1}, we see that we can suppose, at the generic point $x$ of $X$, that we have $\sh{F}_x\neq 0$~\sref[II]{2.3.4.7}.
On the other hand, as $f\circ g$ is projective as $Y$ is Noetherian, the $\RR^q(f\circ g)_*(\OO_{X'}(n))$ are \emph{coherent}~\sref{3.2.2.1}.
This being so, $\RR^\bullet(f\circ g)_*(\OO_{X'}(n))$ is the abutment of a Leray spectral sequence, whose $E_2$-term is given by $E_2^{pq}=\RR^p f_*(\RR^q g_*(\OO_{X'}(n)))$; the above shows that this spectral sequence degenerates, and we then know~\sref[0]{0.11.1.6} that $E_2^{p0}=\RR^p f_*(\sh{F})$ is isomorphic to $\RR^p(f\circ g)_*(\OO_{X'}(n))$, which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[3.2.2]
\label{3.3.2.2}
Let $Y$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme.
For every proper morphism $f:X\to Y$, the direct image under $f$ of any coherent $\OO_X$-module is a coherent $\OO_Y$-module.
\end{cor}

\begin{cor}[3.2.3]
\label{3.3.2.3}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $X$ a proper scheme over $A$; for every coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{F}$, the $\HH^p(X,\sh{F})$ are $A$-modules of finite type, and there exists an integer $r>0$ such that for every coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{F}$ and all $p>r$, $\HH^p(X,\sh{F})=0$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-3.3.2.3}
The second assertion has already been proved~\sref{3.1.4.12}; the first follows from the finiteness theorem~\sref{3.3.2.1}, taking into account Corollary~\sref{3.1.4.11}.
\end{proof}

In particular, if $X$ is a \emph{proper algebraic scheme} over a field $k$, then, for every coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{F}$, the $\HH^p(X,\sh{F})$ are \emph{finite-dimensional} $k$-vector spaces.

\begin{cor}[3.2.4]
\label{3.3.2.4}
Let $Y$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $f:X\to Y$ a morphism of finite type.
For every coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{F}$ whose support in proper over $Y$~\sref[II]{2.5.4.10}, the $\OO_Y$-modules $\RR^q f_*(\sh{F})$ are coherent.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-3.3.2.4}
\oldpage[III]{118}
The question being local on $Y$, we can suppose $Y$ Noetherian, and it is the same for $X$~\sref[I]{1.6.3.7}.
By hypothesis, every closed subprescheme $Z$ of $X$ whose underlying space is $\Supp(\sh{F})$ is proper over $Y$, in other words, if $j:Z\to X$ is the canonical injection, then $f\circ j:Z\to Y$ is proper.
We can suppose that $Z$ is such that $\sh{F}=j_*(\sh{G})$, where $\sh{G}=j^*(\sh{F})$ is a coherent $\OO_Z$-module~\sref[I]{1.9.3.5}; as we have $\RR^q f_*(\sh{F})=\RR^q(f\circ j)_*(\sh{G})$ by Corollary~\sref{3.1.3.4}, the conclusion follows immediately from Theorem~\sref{3.3.2.1}.
\end{proof}
