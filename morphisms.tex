The various classes of morphisms studied in this chapter are used extensively in cohomological methods; further study, using these methods, will be done in Chapter~III, where we use especially \textsection\textsection2,4, and 5 of Chapter~II.
The \textsection8 can be omitted on a first reading: it gives some supplements to the formalism developed in \textsection\textsection1 and 3, reducing to easy maps of this formalism, and we will use it less consistently than the other results of this chapter.
