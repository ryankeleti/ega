# en.ega.i

amateur translation (fr->en) of A. Grothendieck's EGA I.
S’il te plaît pardonne-moi, Grothendieck.

work in progress.

to compile, `pdflatex main.tex` or use `make all`

see `cont.txt` if you want to contribute

## todo

- add original page numbers in the margins here? might make it easier for people to find references if they were originally give by page number [done, use
`\oldpage{x}`]
- search within the .tex files for any `TODO` comments
- examples should _not_ be italicised
- when this is finished (?!) we should [assign a DOI ?](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
- make a list of the commands defined in `commands.tex` and give examples of where they are found in the original text, so that people can check this whenever translating, to ensure consistency of notation

## current status

See `cont.tex` for what people are currently working on.
