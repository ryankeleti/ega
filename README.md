# EGA

amateur translation (French to English) of A. Grothendieck's EGA, starting with EGA I.

S’il-vous plaît pardonnez-nous, Grothendieck.

to compile, `make book`, `make pdfs`, or `make all`.

please do not commit PDF files, instead put `book.pdf` in the `build` release.

## todo

- hyperref links to equations (e.g. 3.3.9.1)
- check for any `\unsure` commands in the source
- check that all `hyperref` references are found
- when this is finished (?!) we should [assign a DOI?](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
- reference for section titles [this](https://stacky.net/wiki/index.php?title=EGA_contents)
- web version? work in progress
