\begin{env}[4.1.1]
\label{1.4.1.1}
As the notion of a quasi-coherent sheaf \sref[0]{0.5.1.3} is local,
a quasi-coherent $\OO_X$-module $\sh{F}$ over a prescheme $X$ can be defined by the condition
that, for each affine open $V$ of $X$, $\sh{F}|V$ is isomorphic to the sheaf associated to a
$\Gamma(V,\OO_X)$-module \sref{1.1.4.1}. It is clear that over a prescheme
$X$, the structure sheaf $\OO_X$ is quasi-coherent and that the kernels, cokernels, and
images of homomorphisms of quasi-coherent $\OO_X$-modules, as well as inductive limits and
direct sums of quasi-coherent $\OO_X$-modules, are also quasi-coherent
(Theorem \sref{1.1.3.7} and Corollary \sref{1.1.3.9}).
\end{env}

\begin{prop}[4.1.2]
\label{1.4.1.2}
Let $X$ be a prescheme, $\sh{I}$ a quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals of $\OO_X$. The support
$Y$ of the sheaf $\OO_X/\sh{I}$ is then closed, and if we denote by $\OO_Y$ the restriction
of $\OO_X/\sh{I}$ to $Y$, then $(Y,\OO_Y)$ is a prescheme.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.4.1.2}
\oldpage[I]{120}
It evidently suffices \sref{1.2.1.3} to consider the case where $X$ is an
affine scheme, and to show that in this case $Y$ is closed in $X$ and is an {\em affine
scheme}. Indeeed, if $X=\Spec(A)$, then we have $\OO_X=\widetilde{A}$ and
$\sh{I}=\widetilde{\mathfrak{I}}$, where $\mathfrak{I}$ is an ideal of $A$
\sref{1.1.4.1}; $Y$ is then equal to the closed subset $V(\mathfrak{I})$ of
$X$ and identifies with the prime spectrum of the ring $B=A/\mathfrak{I}$
\sref{1.1.1.11}; in addition, if $\vphi$ is the canonical
homomorphism $A\to B=A/\mathfrak{I}$, then the direct image ${}^a\vphi_*(\widetilde{B})$
canonically identifies with the sheaf $\widetilde{A}/\widetilde{\mathfrak{I}}=\OO_X/\sh{I}$
(Proposition \sref{1.1.6.3} and Corollary \sref{1.1.3.9}),
which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

We say that $(Y,\OO_Y)$ is the {\em subprescheme} of $(X,\OO_X)$ {\em defined by the
sheaf of ideals $\sh{I}$}; this is a particular case of the more general notion of a
{\em subprescheme}:

\begin{defn}[4.1.3]
\label{1.4.1.3}
We say that a ringed space $(Y,\OO_Y)$ is a subprescheme of a prescheme $(X,\OO_X)$ if:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[1st] $Y$ is a locally closed subspace of $X$;
  \item[2nd] if $U$ denotes the largest open subset of $X$ containing $Y$ such that
    $Y$ is closed in $U$ ({\em equivalently}, the complement in $X$ of the
    boundary of $Y$ with respect to $\overline{Y}$), then $(Y,\OO_Y)$ is
    a subprescheme of $(U,\OO_X|U)$ defined by a quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals of $\OO_X|U$.
\end{enumerate}
We say that the subprescheme $(Y,\OO_Y)$ of $(X,\OO_X)$ is closed if $Y$ is closed in $X$
(in which case $U=X$).
\end{defn}

It follows immediately from this definition and Proposition \sref{1.4.1.2}
that the closed subpreschemes of $X$ are in canonical {\em bijective correspondence} with the
quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals $\sh{J}$ of $\OO_X$, since if two such sheaves
$\sh{J}$, $\sh{J}'$ have the same (closed) support $Y$ and if the restrictions of
$\OO_X/\sh{J}$ and $\OO_X/\sh{J}'$ to $Y$ are \unsure{identical/the identity}, then we have $\sh{J}'=\sh{J}$.

\begin{env}[4.1.4]
\label{1.4.1.4}
Let $(Y,\OO_Y)$ be a subprescheme of $X$, $U$ the largest open subset of $X$ containing $Y$
and in which $Y$ is closed, $V$ an open subset of $X$ contained in $U$; then $V\cap Y$ is
closed in $V$. In addition, if $Y$ is defined by the quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals $\sh{J}$
of $\OO_X|U$, then $\sh{J}|V$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals of $\OO_X|V$, and it is
immediate that the prescheme induced by $Y$ on $Y\cap V$ is the closed subprescheme of $V$
defined by the sheaf of ideals $\sh{J}|V$. Conversely:
\end{env}

\begin{prop}[4.1.5]
\label{1.4.1.5}
Let $(Y,\OO_Y)$ be a ringed space such that $Y$ is a subspace of $X$ and there exists a
cover $(V_\alpha)$ of $Y$ by open subsets of $X$ such that for each $\alpha$,
$Y\cap V_\alpha$ is closed in $V_\alpha$ and the ringed space
$(Y\cap V_\alpha,\OO_Y|(Y\cap V_\alpha))$ is a closed subprescheme of the prescheme induced
on $V_\alpha$ by $X$. Then $(Y,\OO_Y)$ is a subprescheme of $X$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.4.1.5}
The hypotheses imply that $Y$ is locally closed in $X$ and that the largest open $U$
containing $Y$ in which is closed contains all the $V_\alpha$; we can thus reduce to the case
where $U=X$ and $Y$ is closed in $X$. We then define a quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals
$\sh{J}$ of $\OO_X$ by taking $\sh{J}|V_\alpha$ to be the sheaf of ideals of $\OO_X|V_\alpha$
which define the closed subprescheme $(Y\cap V_\alpha,\OO_Y|(Y\cap V_\alpha))$, and for each
open subset $W$ of $X$ not intersecting $Y$, $\sh{J}|W=\OO_X|W$. We check immediately
according to Definition \sref{1.4.1.3} and \sref{1.4.1.4}
that there exists a unique sheaf of ideals $\sh{J}$ satisfying these conditions and that
define the closed subprescheme $(Y,\OO_Y)$.
\end{proof}

In particular, the {\em induced} prescheme by $X$ on an {\em open subset} of $X$ is a
{\em subprescheme} of $X$.

\begin{prop}[4.1.6]
\label{1.4.1.6}
A subprescheme (resp. a closed subprescheme) of a subprescheme
\oldpage[I]{121}
(resp. closed subprescheme) of $X$ canonically identifies with a subprescheme
(resp. closed subprescheme) of $X$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.4.1.6}
Since a locally closed subset of a locally closed subspace of $X$ is a locally closed
subspace of $X$, it is clear \sref{1.4.1.5} that the question is local
and that we can thus suppose that $X$ is affine; the proposition then follows from the
canonical identification of $A/\mathfrak{J}'$ and
$(A/\mathfrak{J})/(\mathfrak{J}'/\mathfrak{J})$ when $\mathfrak{J}$, $\mathfrak{J}'$ are
two ideals of a ring $A$ such that $\mathfrak{J}\subset\mathfrak{J}'$.
\end{proof}

We will always make the previous identification.
\begin{env}[4.1.7]
\label{1.4.1.7}
Let $Y$ be a subprescheme of a prescheme $X$, and denote by $\psi$ the canonical injection
$Y\to X$ of the {\em underlying subspaces}; we know that the inverse image $\psi^*(\OO_X)$ is
the restriction $\OO_X|Y$ \sref[0]{0.3.7.1}. If, for each $y\in Y$,
we denote by $\omega_y$ the canonical homomorphism $(\OO_X)_y\to(\OO_Y)_y$, then these
homomorphisms are the restrictions to stalks of a {\em surjective} homomorphism $\omega$
of sheaves of rings $\OO_X|Y\to\OO_Y$: indeed, is suffices to check locally on $Y$, that is
to say, we can suppose that $X$ is affine and that the subprescheme $Y$ is closed; if in this
case $\sh{I}$ is the sheaf of ideals in $\OO_X$ which defines $Y$, then the $\omega_y$ are
none other than the restriction to stalks of the homomorphism $\OO_X|Y\to(\OO_X/\sh{I})|Y$.
We have thus defined a
{\em monomorphism of ringed spaces} \sref[0]{0.4.1.1}
$j=(\psi,\omega^\flat)$ which is evidently a morphism $Y\to X$ of
preschemes \sref{1.2.2.1}, and we call this the
{\em canonical injection morphism}.

If $f:X\to Z$ is a morphism, we then say that the composite morphism
$Y\xrightarrow{j}X\xrightarrow{f}Z$ is the {\em restriction} of $f$ to the subprescheme $Y$.
\end{env}

\begin{env}[4.1.8]
\label{1.4.1.8}
Conforming to the general definitions (T, I, 1.1), we will say that a morphism of
preschemes $f:Z\to X$ is \unsure{{\em majorized}} by the injection morphism $j:Y\to X$ of
a subprescheme $Y$ of $X$ if $f$ factorizes as $Z\xrightarrow{g}Y\xrightarrow{j}X$, where
$g$ is a morphism of preschemes; $g$ is necessarily {\em unique} since $j$ is a monomorphism.
\end{env}

\begin{prop}[4.1.9]
\label{1.4.1.9}
For a morphism $f:Z\to X$ to be majorized by an injection morphism $j:Y\to X$, it is necessary
and sufficient that $f(Z)\subset Y$ and that for all $z\in Z$, if we set $y=f(z)$, then the
homomorphism $(\OO_X)_y\to\OO_z$ corresponding to $f$ factorizes as $(\OO_Z)_y\to(\OO_Y)_y\to\OO_z$
({\em or equivalently, that} the kernel of $(\OO_X)_y\to\OO_z$ contains the kernel of
$(\OO_X)_y\to(\OO_Y)_y$).
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.4.1.9}
The conditions are evidently necessary. To see that they are sufficient, we can reduce to the case
where $Y$ is a {\em closed} subprescheme of $X$, by replacing if needed $X$ by an open $U$ such that
$Y$ is closed in $U$ \sref{1.4.1.3}; $Y$ is then defined by a quasi-coherent sheaf of
ideals $\sh{I}$ of $\OO_X$. Set $f=(\psi,\theta)$, and let $\sh{J}$ be the sheaf of ideals of
$\psi^*(\OO_X)$, kernel of $\theta^\sharp:\psi^*(\OO_X)\to\OO_Z$; considering the properties of the
functor $\psi^*$ \sref[0]{0.3.7.2}, the hypotheses emply that for each $z\in Z$,
we have $(\psi^*(\sh{I}))_z\subset\sh{J}_z$, and as a result $\psi^*(\sh{I})\subset\sh{J}$. Thus
$\theta^\sharp$ factorizes as
\[
  \psi^*(\OO_X)\longrightarrow\psi^*(\OO_X)/\psi^*(\sh{I})=\psi^*(\OO_X/\sh{I})\xrightarrow{\omega}\OO_Z,
\]
the first arrow being the canonical homomorphish/ Let $\psi'$ be the continuous map $Z\to Y$
coinciding with $\psi$; it is clear that we have ${\psi'}^*(\OO_Y)=\psi^*(\OO_X/\sh{J})$; on the other
hand, $\omega$ is evidently a local homomorphism, so $g=(\psi',\omega^\flat)$ is a morphism
\oldpage[I]{122}
of preschemes $Z\to Y$ \sref{1.2.2.1}, which according to the above is such that
$f=j\circ g$, hence the proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[4.1.10]
\label{1.4.1.10}
For an injection morphism $Z\to X$ to be majorized by the injection morphism $Y\to X$, it is
necessary and sufficient that $Z$ is a subprescheme of $Y$.
\end{cor}

We then write $Z\leqslant Y$, and this condition is evidently an {\em order relation} on the
set of subpreschemes of $X$.
