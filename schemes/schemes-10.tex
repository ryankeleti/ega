\subsection{Formal affine schemes}
\label{subsection-formal-affine-schemes}

\begin{env}[10.1.1]
\label{1.10.1.1}
Let $A$ be an \emph{admissible} topological ring \sref[0]{0.7.1.2}; for each
ideal of definition $\fk{J}$ of $A$, $\Spec(A/\fk{J})$ identifies
with the closed subspace $V(\fk{J})$ of $\Spec(A)$ \sref{1.1.1.11},
the set of \emph{open} prime ideals of $A$; this topological space does not depend
\oldpage[I]{181}
on the ideal of definition $\fk{J}$ considered; we denote this topological
space by $\fk{X}$. Let $(\fk{J}_\lambda)$ be a fundamental system
of neighborhoods of $0$ in $A$, consisting of ideals of definition, and for each
$\lambda$, let $\OO_\lambda$ be the structure sheaf of
$\Spec(A/\fk{J}_\lambda)$; this sheaf is induced on $\fk{X}$ by
$\wt{A}/\wt{\fk{J}_\lambda}$ (which is zero outside of
$\fk{X}$). For $\fk{J}_\mu\subset\fk{J}_\lambda$, the
canonical homomorphism $A/\fk{J}_\mu\to A/\fk{J}_\lambda$ thus
defines a homomorphism $u_{\lambda\mu}:\OO_\mu\to\OO_\lambda$ of sheaves of
rings \sref{1.1.6.1}, and $(\OO_\lambda)$ is a \emph{projective system of
sheaves of rings} for these homomorphisms. As the topology of $\fk{X}$
admits a basis consisting of quasi-compact open subsets, we can associate to
each $\OO_\lambda$ a \emph{sheaf of pseudo-discrete topological rings}
\sref[0]{0.3.8.1} which have $\OO_\lambda$ as the underlying (without topology)
sheaf of rings, and that we denote also by $\OO_\lambda$; and the $\OO_\lambda$ give again a
\emph{projective system of sheaves of topological rings} \sref[0]{0.3.8.2}.
We denote by $\OO_\fk{X}$ the \emph{sheaf of topological rings} on $\fk{X}$, the
projective limit of the system $(\OO_\lambda)$; for each \emph{quasi-compact} open subset $U$
aof $\fk{X}$, then $\Gamma(U,\OO_\fk{X})$ is a topological ring, the projective
limit of the system of \emph{discrete} rings $\Gamma(U,\OO_\lambda)$
\sref[0]{0.3.2.6}.
\end{env}

\begin{defn}[10.1.2]
\label{1.10.1.2}
Given an admissible topological ring $A$, we define the formal spectrum of $A$, and denote
it by $\Spf(A)$, to be the closed subspace $\fk{X}$ of $\Spec(A)$ consisting of the
open prime ideals of $A$. We say that a topologically ringed space is a formal affine scheme
if it is isomorphic to a formal spectrum $\Spf(A)=\fk{X}$ equipped with a sheaf of
topological rings $\OO_\fk{X}$ which is the projective limit of sheaves of
psuedo-discrete topological rings
$(\wt{A}/\wt{\fk{J}_\lambda})|\fk{X}$, where $\fk{J}_\lambda$
varies over the filtered set of ideals of definition for $A$.
\end{defn}

When we speak of a \emph{formal spectrum $\fk{X}=\Spf(A)$} as a formal affine scheme, it will always be as the topologically ringed space $(\fk{X},\OO_\fk{X})$ where $\OO_\fk{X}$ is defined as above.

We note that every \emph{affine scheme} $X=\Spec(A)$ can be considered as a formal affine scheme in only one way, by considering $A$ as a discrete topological ring: the topological rings $\Gamma(U,\OO_X)$ are then discrete whenever $U$ is quasi-compact (but not, in general, when $U$ is an arbitrary open subset of $X$).

\begin{prop}[10.1.3]
\label{1.10.1.3}
If $\fk{X}=\Spf(A)$, where $A$ is an admissible ring, then $\Gamma(\fk{X},\OO_X)$ is topologically isomorphic to $A$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.10.1.3}
Indeed, since $\fk{X}$ is closed in $\Spec(A)$, it is quasi-compact, and so $\Gamma(\fk{X},\OO_\fk{X})$ is topologically isomorphic to the projective limit of the discrete rings $\Gamma(\fk{X},\OO_\lambda)$; but $\Gamma(\fk{X},\OO_\lambda)$ is isomorphic to $A/\fk{J}_\lambda$ \sref{1.1.3.7}; since $A$ is separated and complete, it is topologically isomorphic to $\varprojlim A/\fk{J}_\lambda$ \sref[0]{0.7.2.1}, whence the proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[10.1.4]
\label{1.10.1.4}
Let $A$ be an admissible ring, $\fk{X}=\Spf(A)$, and, for every $f\in A$, let $\fk{D}(f)=D(f)\cap\fk{X}$; then the topologically ringed space $(\fk{D}(f),\OO_\fk{X}|\fk{D}(f))$ is isomorphic to the formal affine spectrum $\Spf(A_{\{f\}}$ \sref[0]{0.7.6.15}.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.10.1.4}
For every \unsure{ideal of definition} $\fk{J}$ of $A$, the discrete ring $S_f^{-1}A/ S_f^{-1}\fk{J}$ is canonically identified with $A_{\{f\}}/\fk{J}_{\{f\}}$ \sref[0]{0.7.6.9}, so, by \sref{1.1.2.5} and \sref{1.1.2.6}, the topological space $\Spf(A_{\{f\}})$ is canonically identified with $\fk{D}(f)$.
Further, for every quasi-compact open subset $U$ of $\fk{X}$ contained in $\fk{D}(f)$, $\Gamma(U,\OO_\lambda)$ can be identified with the module of sections of the structure sheaf of $\Spec(S_f^{-1}A/ S_f^{-1}\fk{J}_\lambda)$ over $U$ \sref{1.1.3.6}, so, setting $\fk{N}=\Spf(A_{\{f\}})$, $\Gamma(U,\OO_\fk{X})$ can be identified with the module of sections $\Gamma(U,\OO_\fk{N})$, which proves the proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{env}[10.1.5]
\label{1.10.1.5}
As a sheaf of rings \emph{without topology}, the structure sheaf $\OO_\fk{X}$ of $\Spf(A)$ admits, for every $x\in\fk{X}$, a fibre which, by \sref{1.10.1.4}, can be identified with the inductive limit $\varinjlim A_{\{f\}}$ for the $f\not\in\fk{j}_x$.
Then, by \sref[0]{0.7.6.17} and \sref[0]{0.7.6.18}:
\end{env}

\begin{prop}[10.1.6]
\label{1.10.1.6}
For every $x\in\fk{X}=\Spf(A)$, the fibre $\OO_x$ is a local ring whose residue field is isomorphic to $\kres(x)=A_x/\fk{j}_xA_x$.
If, further, $A$ is adic and Noetherian, then $\OO_x$ is a Noetherian ring.
\end{prop}

Since $\kres(x)$ is not reduced at $0$, we conclude from this result that the \emph{support} of the ring of sheaves $\OO_\fk{X}$ is \emph{equal to $\fk{X}$}.

\subsection{Morphisms of formal affine schemes}
\label{subsection-morphisms-of-formal-affine-schemes}

\begin{env}[10.2.1]
\label{1.10.2.1}
Let $A$, $B$ be two admissible rings, and let $\vphi:B\to A$ be a \emph{continuous} morphism.
The continuous map ${}^a\vphi:\Spec(A)\to\Spec(B)$ \sref{1.1.2.1} then maps $\fk{X}=\Spf(A)$ to $\fk{Y}=\Spf(B)$, since the inverse image under $\vphi$ of an open prime ideal of $A$ is an open prime ideal of $B$.
On the other hand, for all $g\in B$, $\vphi$ defines a continuous homomorphism $\Gamma(\fk{D}(g),\OO_\fk{Y})\to\Gamma(\fk{D}(\vphi(g)),\OO_\fk{X})$ according to \sref{1.10.1.4}, \sref{1.10.1.3}, and \sref[0]{0.7.6.7}; as these homomorphisms satisfy the compatibility conditions for the restrictions corresponding to the change from $g$ to a multiple of $g$, and as $\fk{D}(\vphi(g))={}^a\vphi^{-1}(\fk{D}(g))$, they define a \emph{continuous} homomorphisms of sheaves of topological rings $\OO_\fk{Y}\to{}^a\vphi_*(\OO_\fk{X})$ \sref[0]{0.3.2.5}, that we denote by $\wt{\vphi}$; we have thus defined a morphism $\Phi=({}^a\vphi,\wt{\vphi})$ of topologically ringed spaces $\fk{X}\to\fk{Y}$.
We note that as a homomorphism of sheaves without topology, $\wt{\vphi}$ defines a homomorphism $\wt{\vphi}_x^\sharp:\OO_{{}^a\vphi(x)}\to\OO_x$ on the stalks, for all $x\in\fk{X}$.
\end{env}

\begin{prop}[10.2.2]
\label{1.10.2.2}
Let $A$, $B$ be two admissible topological rings, and let $\fk{X}=\Spf(A)$, $\fk{Y}=\Spf(B)$.
For a morphism $u=(\psi,\theta):\fk{X}\to\fk{Y}$ of topologically ringed spaces to be of the form $({}^a\vphi,\wt{\vphi})$, where $\vphi$ is a continuous ring homomorphism $B\to A$, it is necessary and sufficient that for all $x\in\fk{X}$, $\theta_x^\sharp$ is a local homomorphism $\OO_{\vphi(x)}\to\OO_x$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.10.2.2}
The condition is necessary: let $\fk{p}=\fk{j}_x\in\Spf(A)$, and let $\fk{q}=\vphi^{-1}(\fk{j}_x)$; if $g\not\in\fk{q}$, then we have $\vphi(g)\not\in\fk{p}$, and it is immediate that the homomorphism
$B_{\{g\}}\to A_{\{\vphi(g)\}}$ induced by $\vphi$ \sref[0]{0.7.6.7} sends $\fk{q}_{\{g\}}$ to a subset of $\fk{p}_{\{\vphi(g)\}}$; by passing to the inductive limit, we see (taking into account \sref{1.10.1.5} and \sref[0]{0.7.6.17}) that $\wt{\vphi}_x^\sharp$ is a local homomorphism.

Conversely, let $(\psi,\theta)$ be a morphism satisying the condition in the statement; according to \sref{1.10.1.3}, $\theta$ defines a continuous ring homomorphism
\[
  \vphi=\Gamma(\theta):B=\Gamma(\fk{Y},\OO_\fk{Y})\longrightarrow\Gamma(\fk{X},\OO_\fk{X})=A.
\]
By virtue of the hypothesis on $\theta$, for the section $\vphi(g)$ of $\OO_\fk{X}$ over $\fk{X}$ to be an invertible germ at the point $x$, it is necessary and sufficient that $g$ is an invertible germ at the point $\psi(x)$.
But according to \sref[0]{0.7.6.17}, the sections of $\OO_\fk{X}$ (resp. $\OO_\fk{Y}$) over $\fk{X}$ (resp. $\OO_\fk{Y}$) whose germ is not invertible at the point $x$ (resp. $\psi(x)$) are exactly the elements of
$\fk{j}_x$
\oldpage[I]{183}
(resp. $\fk{j}_{\psi(x)}$); the above remark thus shows that ${}^a\vphi=\psi$.
Finally, for all $g\in B$ the diagram
\[
  \xymatrix{
    B=\Gamma(\fk{Y},\OO_\fk{Y})\ar[r]^\vphi\ar[d] &
    \Gamma(\fk{X},\OO_\fk{X})=A\ar[d]\\
    B_{\{g\}}=\Gamma(\fk{D}(g),\OO_\fk{Y})\ar[r]^{\Gamma(\theta_{\fk{D}(g)})} &
    \Gamma(\fk{D}(\vphi(g)),\OO_\fk{X})=A_{\{\vphi(g)\}}
  }
\]
is commutative; by the universal property of completed rings of fractions \sref[0]{0.7.6.6}, $\theta_{\fk{D}(g)}$ is equal to $\wt{\vphi}_{\fk{D}(g)}$ for all $g\in B$, so \sref[0]{0.3.2.5} we have $\theta=\wt{\vphi}$.
\end{proof}

We say that a morphism $(\psi,\theta)$ of topologically ringed spaces satisfying the condition of Proposition \sref{1.10.2.2} is a \emph{morphism of formal affine schemes}.
We can say that the functors $\Spf(A)$ in $A$ and $\Gamma(\fk{X},\OO_\fk{X})$ in $\fk{X}$ define an \emph{equivalence} between the cateory of admissible rings and the opposite category of formal affine schemes (T, I, 1.2).

\begin{env}[10.2.3]
\label{1.10.2.3}
As a particular case of \sref{1.10.2.2}, note that for $f\in A$, the canonical injection of the formal affine scheme induced by $\fk{X}$ on $\fk{D}(f)$ corresponds to the continuous canonical homomorphism $A\to A_{\{f\}}$.
Under the hypotheses of Proposition \sref{1.10.2.2}, let $h$ be an element of $B$, $g$ an element of $A$, multiple of $\vphi(h)$; we then have $\psi(\fk{D}(g))\subset\fk{D}(h)$; the restriction of $u$ to $\fk{D}(g)$, considered as a morphism from $\fk{D}(g)$ to $\fk{D}(h)$, is the unique morphism $v$ making the diagram
\[
  \xymatrix{
    \fk{D}(g)\ar[r]^v\ar[d] &
    \fk{D}(h)\ar[d]\\
    \fk{X}\ar[r]^u &
    \fk{Y}
  }
\]
commutative.

This morphism corresponds to the unique continuous homomorphism $\vphi':B_{\{h\}}\to A_{\{g\}}$ \sref[0]{0.7.6.7} making the diagram
\[
  \xymatrix{
    A\ar[d] &
    B\ar[l]_\vphi\ar[d]\\
    A_{\{g\}} &
    B_{\{h\}}\ar[l]_{\vphi'}
  }
\]
commutative.
\end{env}

\subsection{Ideals of definition for a formal affine scheme}
\label{subsection-ideals-of-definition-formal}

\begin{env}[10.3.1]
\label{1.10.3.1}
Let $A$ be an admissible ring, $\fk{J}$ an open ideal of $A$, $\fk{X}$ the formal affine scheme $\Spf(A)$.
Let $(\fk{J}_\lambda)$ be the set of the ideals of definition for $A$ contained in $\fk{J}$; then $\wt{\fk{J}}/\wt{\fk{J}}_\lambda$ is a sheaf of ideals of $\wt{A}/\wt{\fk{J}}_\lambda$.
Denote by $\fk{J}^\Delta$ the projective limit of the induced sheaves on $\fk{X}$ by $\wt{\fk{J}}/\wt{\fk{J}}_\lambda$, which identifies with a \emph{sheaf of ideals} of $\OO_\fk{X}$ \sref[0]{0.3.2.6}.
For every $f\in A$, $\Gamma(\fk{D}(f),\fk{J}^\Delta)$ is the projective limit of the $S_f^{-1}\fk{J}/S_f^{-1}\fk{J}_\lambda$, in other words, it identifies with the open ideal $\fk{J}_{\{f\}}$ of the ring $A_{\{f\}}$ \sref[0]{0.7.6.9}, and in particular $\Gamma(\fk{X},\fk{J}^\Delta)=\fk{J}$; we conclude (the $\fk{D}(f)$ forming a basis for the topology of $\fk{X}$) that we have
\[
  \fk{J}^\Delta|\fk{D}(f)=(\fk{J}_{\{f\}})^\Delta.
  \tag{10.3.1.1}
\]
\end{env}

\begin{env}[10.3.2]
\label{1.10.3.2}
\oldpage[I]{184}
With the notations of \sref{1.10.3.1}, for all $f\in A$, the canonical map from $A_{\{f\}}=\Gamma(\fk{D}(f),\OO_\fk{X})$ to $\Gamma(\fk{D}(f),(\wt{A}/\wt{\fk{J}})|\fk{X})=S_f^{-1}A/S_f^{-1}\fk{J}$ is \emph{surjective} and has for its kernel $\Gamma(\fk{D}(f),\fk{J}^\Delta)=\fk{J}_{\{f\}}$ \sref[0]{0.7.6.9}; these maps thus define a \emph{surjective} continuous homomorphism, said to be \emph{canonical}, from the sheaf of topological rings $\OO_\fk{X}$ to the sheaf of discrete rings $(\wt{A}/\wt{\fk{J}})|\fk{X}$, whose kernel is $\fk{J}^\Delta$; this homomorphism is none other than $\wt{\vphi}$ \sref{1.10.2.1}, where $\vphi$ is the continuous homomorphism $A\to A/\fk{J}$; the morphism $({}^a\vphi,\wt{\vphi}):\Spec(A/\fk{J})\to\fk{X}$ of formal affine schemes (where ${}^a\vphi$ is the identity homeomorphism from $\fk{X}$ to itself) is also called \emph{canonical}.
We thus have, according to the above, a \emph{canonical isomorphism}
\[
  \OO_\fk{X}/\fk{J}^\Delta\isoto(\wt{A}/\wt{\fk{J}})|\fk{X}.
  \tag{10.3.2.1}
\]

It is clear (since $\Gamma(\fk{X},\fk{J}^\Delta)=\fk{J}$) that the map $\fk{J}\to\fk{J}^\Delta$ is \emph{strictly increasing}; according to the above, for $\fk{J}\subset\fk{J}'$, the sheaf ${\fk{J}'}^\Delta/\fk{J}^\Delta$ is canonically isomorphic to $\wt{\fk{J}'}/\wt{\fk{J}}=(\fk{J}'/\fk{J})^\sim$.
\end{env}

\begin{env}[10.3.3]
\label{1.10.3.3}
The hypotheses and notations being the same as those of \sref{1.10.3.1}, we say that a sheaf of ideals $\sh{J}$ of $\OO_\fk{X}$ is a \emph{sheaf of ideals of definition} for $\fk{X}$ (or an \emph{ideal sheaf of definition} for $\fk{X}$) if, for all $x\in\fk{X}$, there exists an open neighborhood of $x$ of the form $\fk{D}(f)$, where $f\in A$, such that $\sh{J}|\fk{D}(f)$ is of the form $\fk{H}^\Delta$, where $\fk{H}$ is an ideal of definition for $A_{\{f\}}$.
\end{env}

\begin{prop}[10.3.4]
\label{1.10.3.4}
For all $f\in A$, each sheaf of ideals of definition for $\fk{X}$ induces a sheaf of ideals of definition for $\fk{D}(f)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.10.3.4}
This follows from (10.3.1.1).
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[10.3.5]
\label{1.10.3.5}
If $A$ is an admissible ring, then every sheaf of ideals of definition for $\fk{X}=\Spf(A)$ is of the form $\fk{J}^\Delta$, where $\fk{J}$ is an ideal of definition for $A$, uniquely determined.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.10.3.5}
Let $\sh{J}$ be a sheaf of ideals of definition of $\fk{X}$; by hypothesis, and since $\fk{X}$ is quasi-compact, there is a finite number of elements $f_i\in A$ such that the $\fk{D}(f_i)$ cover $\fk{X}$ and that $\sh{J}|\fk{D}(f_i)=\fk{H}_i^\Delta$, where $\fk{H}_i$ is an ideal of definition for $A_{\{f_i\}}$.
For each $i$, there exists an open ideal $\fk{K}_i$ of $A$ such that $(\fk{K}_i)_{\{f_i\}}=\fk{H}_i$ \sref[0]{0.7.6.9}; let $\fk{K}$ be an ideal of definition for $A$ containing all the $\fk{K}_i$.
The canonical image of $\sh{J}/\fk{K}^\Delta$ in the structure sheaf $(A/\fk{K})^\sim$ of $\Spec(A/\fk{K})$ \sref{1.10.3.2} is thus such that its restriction to $\fk{D}(f_i)$ is equal to its restriction to $(\fk{K}_i/\fk{K})^\sim$;
we conclude that this canonical image is a \emph{quasi-coherent} sheaf on $\Spec(A/\fk{K})$, so it is of the form $(\fk{J}/\fk{K})^\sim$, where $\fk{J}$ is an ideal of definition for $A$ containing $\fk{K}$ \sref{1.1.4.1} hence $\sh{J}=\fk{J}^\Delta$ \sref{1.10.3.2};
in addition, as for each $i$ there exists an integer $n_i$ such that $\fk{H}_i^{n_i}\subset\fk{K}_{\{f_i\}}$, we will have, by setting $n$ to be the largest of the $n_i$, $(\sh{J}/\fk{K}^\Delta)^n=0$, and as a result \sref{1.10.3.2} $((\fk{J}/\fk{K})^\sim)^n=0$, so finally $(\fk{J}/\fk{K})^n=0$ \sref{1.1.3.13}, which prove that $\fk{J}$ is an ideal of definition for $A$ \sref[0]{0.7.1.4}.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[10.3.6]
\label{1.10.3.6}
Let $A$ be an adic ring, $\fk{J}$ an ideal of definition for $A$ such that $\fk{J}/\fk{J}^2$ is an $(A/\fk{J})$-module of finite type. For any integer $n>0$, we then have $(\fk{J}^\Delta)^n=(\fk{J}^n)^\Delta$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.10.3.6}
For all $f\in A$, we have (since $\fk{J}^n$ is an open ideal)
\[
  (\Gamma(\fk{D}(f),\fk{J}^\Delta))^n=(\fk{J}_{\{f\}})^n=(\fk{J}^n)_{\{f\}}=\Gamma(\fk{D}(f^n),(\fk{J}^n)^\Delta)
\]
\oldpage[I]{185}
according to (10.3.1.1) and \sref[0]{0.7.6.12}.
As $(\fk{J}^\Delta)^n$ is associated to the presheaf $U\mapsto(\Gamma(U,\fk{J}^\Delta))^n$ \sref[0]{0.4.1.6}, the result follows, since the $\fk{D}(f)$ form a basis for the topology of $\fk{X}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{env}[10.3.7]
\label{1.10.3.7}
We say that a family $(\sh{J}_\lambda)$ of sheaves of ideals of definition for $\fk{X}$ is a \emph{fundamental system of sheaves of ideals of definition} if each sheaf of ideals of definition for $\fk{X}$ contains one of the $\sh{J}_\lambda$; as $\sh{J}_\lambda=\fk{J}_\lambda^\Delta$, it is equivalent to say that the $\fk{J}_\lambda$ for a \emph{fundamental system of neighborhoods of $0$} in $A$.
Let $(f_\alpha)$ be a family of elements of $A$ such that the $\fk{D}(f_\alpha)$ cover $\fk{X}$.
If $(\sh{J}_\lambda)$ is a filtered decreasing family of sheaves of ideals of $\OO_\fk{X}$ such that for each $\alpha$, the family $(\sh{J}_\lambda|\fk{D}(f_\alpha))$ is a fundamental system of sheaves of ideals of definition for $\fk{D}(f_\alpha)$, then $(\sh{J}_\lambda)$ is a fundamental system of sheaves of ideals of definition for $\fk{X}$.
Indeed, for each sheaf of ideals of definition $\sh{J}$ for $\fk{X}$, there is a finite cover of $\fk{X}$ by $\fk{D}(f_i)$ such that, for each $i$, $\sh{J}_{\lambda_i}|\fk{D}(f_i)$ is a sheaf of ideals of definition for $\fk{D}(f_i)$ contained in $\sh{J}|\fk{D}(f_i)$.
If $\mu$ is an index such that $\sh{J}_\mu\subset\sh{J}_{\lambda_i}$ for all $i$, then it follows from \sref{1.10.3.3} that $\sh{J}_\mu$ is a sheaf of ideals of definition for $\fk{X}$, evidently contained in $\sh{J}$, hence our assertion.
\end{env}

\subsection{Formal preschemes and morphisms of formal preschemes}
\label{subsection-formal-preschemes-and-morphisms}

\begin{env}[10.4.1]
\label{1.10.4.1}
Given a topologically ringed space $\fk{X}$, we say that an open $U\subset\fk{X}$ is an \emph{formal affine open} (resp. an \emph{formal adic affine open}, resp. an \emph{formal Noetherian affine open}) if the topologically ringed space induced on $U$ by $\fk{X}$ is a formal affine scheme (resp. a scheme whose ring is adic, resp. adic and Noetherian).
\end{env}

\begin{defn}[10.4.2]
\label{1.10.4.2}
A \emph{formal prescheme} is a topologically ringed spacd $\fk{X}$ which admits a formal affine open neighborhood for each point.
We say that the formal prescheme $\fk{X}$ is adic (resp. locally Noetherian) if each point of $\fk{X}$ admits a formal adic (resp. Noetherian) open neighborhood.
We say that $\fk{X}$ is Noetherian if it is locally Noetherian and if its underlying space is quasi-compact (hence Noetherian).
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}[10.4.3]
\label{1.10.4.3}
If $\fk{X}$ is a formal prescheme (resp. a locally Noetherian formal prescheme), then the formal affine (resp. Noetherian affine) open sets form a basis for the topology of $\fk{X}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.10.4.3}
This follows from Definition \sref{1.10.4.2} and Proposition \sref{1.10.1.4} by taking into account that if $A$ is an adic Noetherian ring, then so if $A_{\{f\}}$ for all $f\in A$ \sref[0]{0.7.6.11}.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[10.4.4]
\label{1.10.4.4}
If $\fk{X}$ is a formal prescheme (resp. a locally Noetherian formal prescheme, resp. a Noetherian formal prescheme), then the topologically ringed space induced on each open set of $\fk{X}$ a formal prescheme (resp. a locally Noetherian formal prescheme, resp. a Noetherian formal prescheme).
\end{cor}

\begin{defn}[10.4.5]
\label{1.10.4.5}
Given two formal preschemes $\fk{X}$ and $\fk{Y}$, a morphism (of formal preschemes) from $\fk{X}$ to $\fk{Y}$ is a morphism $(\psi,\theta)$ of topologically ringed spaces such that, for all $x\in\fk{X}$, $\theta_x^\sharp$ is a local homomorphism $\OO_{\psi(x)}\to\OO_x$.
\end{defn}

It is immediate that the composition of two morphisms of formal preschemes is again a morphism of formal preschemes; the formal preschemes thus form a \emph{category}, and we denote by $\Hom(\fk{X},\fk{Y})$ the set of morphisms from a formal prescheme $\fk{X}$ to a formal prescheme $\fk{Y}$.

\oldpage[I]{186}
If $U$ is an open subset of $\fk{X}$, then the canonical injection into $\fk{X}$ of the formal prescheme induced on $U$ by $\fk{X}$ is a morphism of formal preschemes (and similarly a \emph{momomorphism} of topologically ringed spaces \sref[0]{0.4.1.1}).

\begin{prop}[10.4.6]
\label{1.10.4.6}
Let $\fk{X}$ be a formal prescheme, $\fk{S}=\Spf(A)$ a formal affine scheme.
There exists a canonical bijective equivalence between the morphisms from a formal prescheme $\fk{X}$ to the formal prescheme $\fk{S}$ and the continuous homomorphisms from the ring $A$ to the topological ring $\Gamma(\fk{X}.\OO_\fk{X})$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.10.4.6}
The proof is similar to that of \sref{1.2.2.4}, by replacing ``homomorphism'' by ``continuous homomorphism'', ``affine open'' by ``formal affine open'', and by using Proposition \sref{1.10.2.2} instead of Theorem \sref{1.1.7.3}; we leave the details to the reader.
\end{proof}

\begin{env}[10.4.7]

Given a formal prescheme $\fk{S}$, we say that the data of a formal prescheme $\fk{X}$ and a morphism $\vphi:\fk{X}\to\fk{S}$ defines a formal prescheme \emph{$\fk{X}$ over $\fk{S}$} or an \emph{formal $\fk{S}$-prescheme}, $\vphi$ being called the \emph{structure morphism} of the $\fk{S}$-prescheme $\fk{X}$.
If $\fk{S}=\Spf(A)$, where $A$ is an admissible ring, then we also say that the formal $\fk{S}$-prescheme $\fk{X}$ is a \emph{formal $A$-prescheme} or a formal prescheme \emph{over $A$}.
An arbitrary formal prescheme can be considered as a formal prescheme over $\bb{Z}$ (equipped with the discrete topology).

If $\fk{X}$ and $\fk{Y}$ are two formal $\fk{S}$-preschemes, we say that a morphism $u:\fk{X}\to\fk{Y}$ is a \emph{$\fk{S}$-morphism} if the diagram
\[
  \xymatrix{
    \fk{X}\ar[rr]^u\ar[rd] & &
    \fk{Y}\ar[ld]\\
    & \fk{S}
  }
\]
(where the downwards arrows are the structure morphisms) is commutative.
With this definition, the formal $\fk{S}$-preschemes (for $\fk{S}$ fixed) forms a \emph{category}.
We denote by $\Hom_\fk{S}(\fk{X},\fk{Y})$ the set of $\fk{S}$-morphisms from a formal $\fk{S}$-prescheme $\fk{X}$ to a formal $\fk{S}$-prescheme $\fk{Y}$.
When $\fk{S}=\Spf(A)$, we also say \emph{$A$-morphism} instead of \emph{$\fk{S}$-morphism}.

As each affine scheme can be considered as a formal affine scheme \sref{1.10.1.2}, each (usual) prescheme can be considered as a formal prescheme.
In addition, it follows from Definition \sref{1.10.4.5} that for the \emph{usual} preschemes, the morphisms (resp. $S$-morphisms) of \emph{formal} preschemes coincide with the morphisms (resp. $S$-morphisms) defined in \textsection2.
