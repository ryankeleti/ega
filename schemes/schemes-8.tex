\subsection{Allied local rings}
\label{subsection-allied-local-rings}

For each local ring $A$, we denote by $\mathfrak{m}(A)$ the maximal ideal of
$A$.

\begin{lem}[8.1.1]
\label{1.8.1.1}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two local rings such that $A\subset B$;
then the following conditions are equivalent: {\em (i)}
$\mathfrak{m}(B)\cap A=\mathfrak{m}(A)$; {\em (ii)}
$\mathfrak{m}(A)\subset\mathfrak{m}(B)$; {\em (iii)} $1$ is not an element of
the ideal of $B$ generated by $\mathfrak{m}(A)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.1.1}
It is evident that (i) implies (ii), and (ii) implies (iii); lastly, if (iii) is
true, then $\mathfrak{m}(B)\cap A$ contains $\mathfrak{m}(A)$ and does not
contain $1$, and is thus equal to $\mathfrak{m}(A)$.

When the equivalent conditions of \sref{1.8.1.1} are satisfied, we say that $B$
{\em dominates} $A$; this is equivalent to saying that the injection $A\to B$
is a {\em local} homomorphism. It is clear that, in the set of local subrings
of a ring $R$, the relation given by domination is an \unsure{order}.
\end{proof}

\begin{env}[8.1.2]
\label{1.8.1.2}
Now consider a {\em field} $R$. For all subrings $A$ of
$R$, we denote by $L(A)$ the set of local rings $A_\mathfrak{p}$, where
$\mathfrak{p}$ runs over the prime spectrum of $A$; they are identified with the
subrings of $R$ containing $A$. Since
$\mathfrak{p}=(\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})\cap A$, the map
$\mathfrak{p}\mapsto A_\mathfrak{p}$ from $\Spec(A)$ to $L(A)$ is bijective.
\end{env}

\begin{lem}[8.1.3]
\label{1.8.1.3}
Let $R$ be a field, and $A$ a subring of $R$. For a
local subring $M$ of $R$ to dominate a ring $A_\mathfrak{p}\in L(A)$ it is
necessary and sufficient that $A\subset M$; the local ring $A_\mathfrak{p}$
dominated by $M$ is then unique, and corresponds to
$\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{m}(M)\cap A$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.1.3}
If $M$ dominates $A_\mathfrak{p}$, then
$\mathfrak{m}(M)\cap A_\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p}$,
by \sref{1.8.1.1}, whence the uniqueness of $\mathfrak{p}$; on the other hand,
if $A\subset M$, then $\mathfrak{m}M\cap A=\mathfrak{p}$ is prime in $A$, and since
$A-\mathfrak{p}\subset M$, we have that $A_\mathfrak{p}\subset M$ and
$\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathfrak{m}(M)$, so $M$ dominates
$A_\mathfrak{p}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}[8.1.4]
\label{1.8.1.4}
\oldpage[I]{165}
Let $R$ be a field, $M$ and $N$ two local subrings of $R$, and $P$ the subring of $R$
generated by $M\cup N$. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[label={\rm(\roman*)}]
  \item There exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $P$ such that
    $\mathfrak{m}(M)=\mathfrak{p}\cap M$ and $\mathfrak{m}(N)=\mathfrak{p}\cap N$.
  \item The ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ generated in $P$ by $\mathfrak{m}(M)\cup\mathfrak{m}(N)$ is
    distinct from $P$.
  \item There exists a local subring $Q$ of $R$ simultaneously dominating both $M$ and $N$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.1.4}
It is clear that (i) implies (ii); conversely, if $\mathfrak{a}\neq P$, then
$\mathfrak{a}$ is contained in a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of $P$, and since
$1\not\in\mathfrak{n}$, $\mathfrak{n}\cap M$ contains $\mathfrak{m}(M)$ and is
distinct from $M$, so $\mathfrak{n}\cap M=\mathfrak{m}(M)$, and similarly
$\mathfrak{n}\cap N=\mathfrak{m}(N)$. It is clear that, if $Q$ dominates both
$M$ and $N$, then $P\subset Q$ and
$\mathfrak{m}(M)=\mathfrak{m}(Q)\cap M=(\mathfrak{m}(Q)\cap P)\cap M$, and
$\mathfrak{m}(N)=(\mathfrak{m}(Q)\cap P)\cap N$, so (iii) implies (i); the converse
is evident when we take $Q=P_\mathfrak{p}$.
\end{proof}

When the conditions of \sref{1.8.1.4} are satisfied, we say, with C.~Chevalley,
that the local rings $M$ and $N$ are {\em allied}.

\begin{prop}[8.1.5]
\label{1.8.1.5}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two subrings of a field $R$,
and $C$ the subring of $R$ generated by $A\cup B$. Then the following
conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[label={\rm(\roman*)}]
  \item For every local ring $Q$ containing $A$ and $B$, we have that
    $A_\mathfrak{p}=B_\mathfrak{q}$, where $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{m}(Q)\cap A$ and
    $\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{m}(Q)\cap B$.
  \item For all prime ideals $\mathfrak{r}$ of $C$, we have that
    $A_\mathfrak{p}=B_\mathfrak{q}$, where $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{r}\cap A$ and
    $\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{r}\cap B$.
  \item If $M\in L(A)$ and $N\in L(B)$ are allied, then they are identical.
  \item $L(A)\cap L(B)=L(C)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.1.5}
Lemmas \sref{1.8.1.3} and \sref{1.8.1.4} prove that (i) and (iii) are equivalent; it
is clear that (i) implies (ii) by taking $Q=C_\mathfrak{r}$; conversely, (ii)
implies (i), because if $Q$ contains $A\cup B$ then it contains $C$, and if
$\mathfrak{r}=\mathfrak{m}(Q)\cap C$ then $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{r}\cap A$ and
$\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{r}\cap B$, from \sref{1.8.1.3}. It is immediate that (iv)
implies (i), because if $Q$ contains $A\cup B$ then it dominates a local ring
$C_\mathfrak{r}\in L(C)$ by \sref{1.8.1.3}; by hypothesis we have that
$C_\mathfrak{r}\in L(A)\cap L(B)$, and \sref{1.8.1.1} and \sref{1.8.1.3} prove that
$C_\mathfrak{r}=A_\mathfrak{p}=B_\mathfrak{q}$. We prove finally that (iii)
implies (iv). Let $Q\in L(C)$; $Q$ dominates some $M\in L(A)$ and some $N\in
L(B)$ \sref{1.8.1.3}, so $M$ and $N$, being allied, are identical by hypothesis.
As we then have that $C\subset M$, we know that $M$ dominates some $Q'\in L(C)$
\sref{1.8.1.3}, so $Q$ dominates $Q'$, whence necessarily \sref{1.8.1.3} $Q=Q'=M$,
so $Q\in L(A)\cap L(B)$. Conversely, if $Q\in L(A)\cap L(B)$, then $C\subset
Q$, so \sref{1.8.1.3} $Q$ dominates some $Q''\in L(C)\subset L(A)\cap L(B)$; $Q$
and $Q''$, being allied, are identical, so $Q''=Q\in L(C)$, which completes the
proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Local rings of an integral scheme}
\label{subsection-local-rings-of-integral-scheme}

\begin{env}[8.2.1]
\label{1.8.2.1}
Let $X$ be an {\em integral} prescheme, and $R$ its field of
rational functions, identical to the local ring of the generic point $a$ of $X$;
for all $x\in X$, we know that $\OO_x$ can be canonically identified with a
subring of $R$ \sref{1.7.1.5}, and for every rational function $f\in R$, the
domain of definition $\delta(f)$ of $f$ is the open set of $x\in X$ such that
$f\in\OO_x$. It thus follows from \sref{1.7.2.6} that, for every open $U\subset X$,
we have
\[
  \Gamma(U,\OO_X)=\bigcap_{x\in U}\OO_x.
  \tag{8.2.1.1}
\]
\end{env}

\begin{prop}[8.2.2]
\label{1.8.2.2}
\oldpage[I]{166}
Let $X$ be an integral prescheme,
and $R$ its field of rational fractions. For $X$ to be a scheme, it is
necessary and sufficient that the relation ``$\OO_x$ and $\OO_y$ are allied''
\sref{1.8.1.4}, for points $x$, $y$ of $X$, implies that $x=y$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.2.2}
We suppose that this condition is verified, and aim to show that $X$ is separated.
Let $U$ and $V$ be two distinct affine opens of $X$, with rings $A$ and $B$,
identified with subrings of $R$; $U$ (resp. $V$) is thus identified \sref{1.8.1.2}
with $L(A)$ (resp. $L(B)$), and the hypotheses tell us \sref{1.8.1.5} that $C$ is
the subring of $R$ generated by $A\cup B$, and $W=U\cap V$ is identified with
$L(A)\cap L(B)=L(C)$. Furthermore, we know
(\cite{I-1}, p.~\unsure{5-03},~4~{\em bis}) that every subring $E$ of $R$ is
equal to the intersection of the local rings belonging to $L(E)$; $C$ is thus
identified with the intersection of the rings $\OO_z$ for $z\in W$, or,
equivalently (8.2.1.1) with $\Gamma(W,\OO_X)$. So consider the subprescheme
induced by $X$ on $W$; to the \unsure{identity} morphism $\vphi:
C\to\Gamma(W,\OO_X)$ there corresponds \sref{1.2.2.4} a morphism
$\Phi=(\psi,\theta):W\to\Spec(C)$; we will see that $\Phi$ is an
{\em isomorphism} of preschemes, whence $W$ is an {\em affine} open. The
identification of $W$ with $L(C)=\Spec(C)$ shows that $\psi$ is
{\em bijective}.On the other hand, for all $x\in W$, $\theta_x^\sharp$ is the
injection $C_\mathfrak{r}\to\OO_x$, where $\mathfrak{r}=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap C$,
and by definition $C_\mathfrak{r}$ is identified with $\OO_x$, so $\theta_x^\sharp$
is bijective. It thus remains to show that $\psi$ is a {\em homeomorphism},
i.e. that for every closed subset $F\subset W$, $\psi(F)$ is closed in
$\Spec(C)$. But $F$ is the \unsure{trace over} $W$ of closed subspace of $U$,
of the form $V(\mathfrak{a})$, where $\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal of $A$; we show
that $\psi(F)=V(\mathfrak{a}C)$, which proves our claim. In fact, the prime
ideals of $C$ containing $\mathfrak{a}C$ are the prime ideals of $C$ containing
$\mathfrak{a}$, and so are the ideals of the form $\psi(x)=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap
C$, where $\mathfrak{a}\subset\mathfrak{m}_x$ and $x\in W$; since
$\mathfrak{a}\subset\mathfrak{m}_x$ is equivalent to $x\in V(\mathfrak{a})=W\cap
F$ for $x\in U$, we do indeed have that $\psi(F)=V(\mathfrak{a}C)$.

It follows that $X$ is separated, because $U\cap V$ is affine and its ring $C$
is generated by the union $A\cup B$ of the rings of $U$ and $V$ \sref{1.5.5.6}.

Conversely, suppose that $X$ is separated, and let $x$, $y$ be two points of $X$
such that $\OO_x$ and $\OO_y$ are allied. Let $U$ (resp. $V$) be an affine open
containing $x$ (resp. $y$), of ring $A$ (resp. $B$); we then know that $U\cap V$
is affine and that its ring $C$ is generated by $A\cup B$ \sref{1.5.5.6}. If
$\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap A$ and $\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{m}_y\cap B$,
then $A_\mathfrak{p}=\OO_x$ and $B_\mathfrak{q}=\OO_y$, and since $A_\mathfrak{p}$
and $B_\mathfrak{q}$ are allied, there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{r}$ of
$C$ such that $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{r}\cap A$ and
$\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{r}\cap B$ \sref{1.8.1.4}. But then there exists a point
$z\in U\cap V$ such that $\mathfrak{r}=\mathfrak{m}_z\cap C$, since $U\cap V$ is
affine, and so evidently $x=z$ and $y=z$, whence $x=y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[8.2.3]
\label{1.8.2.3}
Let $X$ be an integral scheme, and $x$, $y$ two
points of $X$.In order that $x\in\overline{\{y\}}$, it is necessary and
sufficient that $\OO_x\subset\OO_y$, or, equivalently, that every rational
function defined at $x$ is also defined at $y$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.2.3}
The condition is evidently necessary because the domain of definition
$\delta(f)$ of a rational function $f\in R$ is open; we now show that it is
sufficient.If $\OO_x\subset\OO_y$, then there exists a prime ideal
$\mathfrak{p}$ of $\OO_x$ such that $\OO_y$ dominates $(\OO_x)_\mathfrak{p}$
\sref{1.8.1.3}; but \sref{1.2.4.2} there exists $z\in X$ such that
$x\in\overline{\{z\}}$ and $\OO_z=(\OO_x)_\mathfrak{p}$; since $\OO_z$ and $\OO_y$
are allied, we have that $z=y$ by \sref{1.8.2.2}, whence the corollary.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[8.2.4]
\label{1.8.2.4}
If $X$ is an integral scheme then the map
$x\to\OO_x$ is injective; equivalently, if $x$ and $y$ are two distinct points of
$X$, then there exists a rational function defined at one of these points but
not the other.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.2.4}
\oldpage[I]{167}
This follows from \sref{1.8.2.3} and the axiom ($T_0$) \sref{1.2.1.4}.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[8.2.5]
\label{1.8.2.5}
Let $X$ be an integral scheme whose underlying
space is Noetherian; letting $f$ run over the field $R$ of rational functions on
$X$, the sets $\delta(f)$ generate the topology of $X$.
\end{cor}

In fact, every closed subset of $X$ is thus a finite union of irreducible closed
subsets, i.e., of the form $\overline{\{y\}}$ \sref{1.2.1.5}. But, if
$x\not\in\overline{\{y\}}$, then there exists a rational function $f$ defined at
$x$ but not at $y$ \sref{1.8.2.3}, or, equivalently, we have that $x\in\delta(f)$
and $\delta(f)$ is not contained in $\overline{\{y\}}$. The complement of
$\overline{\{y\}}$ is thus a union of sets of the form $\delta(f)$, and by
virtue of the first remark, every open subset of $X$ is the union of finite
intersections of open sets of the form $\delta(f)$.

\begin{env}[8.2.6]
\label{1.8.2.6}
Corollary \sref{1.8.2.5} shows that the topology of $X$ is
entirely characterised by the data of the local rings $(\OO_x)_{x\in X}$ that
have $R$ as their field of fractions. It amounts to the same to say that the
closed subsets of $X$ are defined in the following manner: given a finite subset
$\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ of $X$, consider the set of $y\in X$ such that
$\OO_y\subset\OO_{x_i}$ for at least one index $i$, and these sets (over all
choices of $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$) are the closed subsets of $X$. Further, once
the topology on $X$ is known, the structure sheaf $\OO_X$ is also determined by
the family of the $\OO_x$, since $\Gamma(U,\OO_X)=\bigcap_{x\in U}\OO_x$ by
(8.2.1.1). The family $(\OO_X)_{x\in X}$ thus completely determines the
prescheme $X$ when $X$ is an integral scheme whose underlying space is
Noetherian.
\end{env}

\begin{prop}[8.2.7]
\label{1.8.2.7}
Let $X$, $Y$ be two integral schemes, $f:X\to Y$ a dominant morphism
\sref{1.2.2.6}, and $K$ (resp.$L$) the field of rational
functions on $X$ (resp.$Y$). Then $L$ can be identified with a subfield of
$K$, and for all $x\in X$, $\OO_{f(x)}$ is the unique local ring of $Y$ dominated
by $\OO_x$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.2.7}
If $f=(\psi,\theta)$ and $a$ is the generic point of $X$, then
$\psi(a)$ is the generic point of $Y$ \sref[0]{0.2.1.5}; $\theta_a^\sharp$ is then
a monomorphism of fields, from $L=\OO_{\psi(a)}$ to $K=\OO_a$. Since every
non-empty affine open $U$ of $Y$ contains $\psi(a)$, it follows from
\sref{1.2.2.4} that the homomorphism $\Gamma(U,\OO_Y)\to\Gamma(\psi^{-1}(U),\OO_X)$
corresponding to $f$ is the restriction of $\theta_a^\sharp$ to $\Gamma(U,\OO_Y)$.
So, for every $x\in X$, $\theta_x^\sharp$ is the restriction to $\OO_{\psi(a)}$ of
$\theta_a^\sharp$, and is thus a monomorphism. We also know that $\theta_x^\sharp$ is a
local homomorphism, so, if we identify $L$ with a subfield of $K$ by
$\theta_a^\sharp$, $\OO_{\psi(x)}$ is dominated by $\OO_x$ \sref{1.8.1.1}; it is also
the only local ring of $Y$ dominated by $\OO_x$, since two local rings of $Y$
that are allied are identical \sref{1.8.2.2}.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[8.2.8]
\label{1.8.2.8}
Let $X$ be an {\em irreducible} prescheme; and
$f:X\to Y$ a local immersion ({\em resp.} a local isomorphism); and
suppose further that $f$ is separated. Then $f$ is an immersion ({\em resp.}
an open immersion).
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-1.8.2.8}
Let $f=(\psi,\theta)$; it suffices, in both cases, to prove that $\psi$ is a
{\em homeomorphism} from $X$ to $\psi(X)$ \sref{1.4.5.3}. Replacing $f$ by
$f_\text{red}$ (\sref{1.5.1.6} and \sref{1.5.5.1}, (vi)), we can assume that $X$
and $Y$ are {\em reduced}. If $Y'$ is the closed reduced subprescheme of $Y$
having $\overline{\psi(X)}$ as its underlying space, then $f$ factorizes as
$X\xrightarrow{f'}Y'\xrightarrow{j}Y$, where $j$ is the canonical injection
\sref{1.5.2.2}. It follows from \sref{1.5.5.1}, (v) that $f'$ is again a
separated morphism; further, $f'$ is again
\oldpage[I]{168}
a local immersion (resp. a local isomorphism), because, since the condition is local on $X$
and $Y$, we can reduce ourselves to the case where $f$ is a closed immersion (resp. open
immersion), and then our claim follows immediately from \sref{1.4.2.2}.

We can thus suppose that $f$ is a {\em dominant} morphism, which leads to the
fact that $Y$ is, itself, irreducible \sref[0]{0.2.1.5}, and so $X$ and $Y$
are both {\em integral}. Further, the condition being local on $Y$, we can
suppose that $Y$ is an affine scheme; since $f$ is separated, $X$ is a scheme
\sref{1.5.5.1}, (ii), and we are finally at the hypotheses of Proposition \sref{1.8.2.7}.
Then, for all $x\in X$, $\theta_x^\sharp$ is injective; but the hypothesis that $f$
is a local immersion implies that $\theta_x^\sharp$ is surjective \sref{1.4.2.2}, so
$\theta_x^\sharp$ is bijective, or, equivalently (with the identification of Proposition
\sref{1.8.2.7}) we have that $\OO_{\psi(x)}=\OO_x$. This implies, by
Corollary \sref{1.8.2.4},
that $\psi$ is an {\em injective} map, which already proves the proposition
when $f$ is a local isomorphism \sref{1.4.5.3}. When we suppose that $f$ is only
a local immersion, for all $x\in X$ there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of
$x$ in $X$ and an open neighborhood $V$ of $\psi(x)$ in $Y$ such that the
restriction of $\psi$ to $U$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ to a {\em closed}
subset of $V$. But $U$ is dense in $X$, so $\psi(U)$ is dense in $Y$ and
{\em a fortiori} in $V$, which proves that $\psi(U)=V$; since $\psi$ is
injective, $\psi^{-1}(V)=U$ and this proves that $\psi$ is a homeomorphism from
$X$ to $\psi(X)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Chevalley schemes}
\label{subsection-chevalley-schemes}

\begin{env}[8.3.1]
\label{1.8.3.1}
Let $X$ be a {\em Noetherian} integral scheme, and $R$ its
field of rational functions; we denote by $X'$ the set of local subrings
$\OO_x\subset R$, where $x$ runs over all points of $X$. The set $X'$ satisfies
the three following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(Sch.~1)] For all $M\in X'$, $R$ is the field of fractions of $M$.
  \item[(Sch.~2)] There exists a finite set of Noetherian subrings $A_i$ of $R$
    such that $X'=\bigcup_i L(A_i)$, and, for all pairs of indices $i$, $j$, the subring
    $A_{ij}$ of $R$ generated by $A_i\cup A_j$ is an algebra of finite type over $A_i$.
  \item[(Sch.~3)] Two elements $M$ and $N$ of $X'$ that are allied are identical.
\end{enumerate}
\end{env}

We have seen in \sref{1.8.2.1} that (Sch.~1) is satisfied, and (Sch.~3)
follows from \sref{1.8.2.2}. To show (Sch.~2), it suffices to cover $X$ by a
finite number of affine opens $U_i$, whose rings are Noetherian, and to take
$A_i=\Gamma(U_i,\OO_X)$; the hypothesis that $X$ is a scheme implies that
$U_i\cap U_j$ is affine, and also that $\Gamma(U_i\cap U_j,\OO_X)=A_{ij}$
\sref{1.5.5.6}; further, since the space $U_i$ is Noetherian, the immersion
$U_i\cap U_j\to U_i$ is of finite type \sref{1.6.3.5}, so $A_{ij}$ is an
$A_i$-algebra of finite type \sref{1.6.3.3}.

\begin{env}[8.3.2]
\label{1.8.3.2}
The structures whose axioms are (Sch.~1), (Sch.~2), and
(Sch.~3), generalise ``schemes'' in the sense of C.~Chevalley, who supposes
furthermore that $R$ is an extension of finite type of a field $K$, and that the
$A_i$ are $K$-algebras of finite type (which renders a part of (Sch.~2) useless)
\cite{I-1}. Conversely, if we have such a structure on a set $X'$, then we can
associate to it an integral scheme $X$ by using the remarks from \sref{1.8.2.6}:
the underlying space of $X$ is equal to $X'$ endowed with the topology defined
in \sref{1.8.2.6}, and with the sheaf $\OO_X$ such that
$\Gamma(U,\OO_X)=\bigcap_{x\in U}\OO_x$ for all open $U\subset X$, with the
evident definition of restriction homomorphisms. We leave to the reader the
task of verifying that we obtain thusly an integral scheme, whose local rings
are the elements of $X'$; we will not use this result in what follows.
\end{env}
