Sections \textsection\textsection1--8 do little more than develop a language, which will be used in what follows.
It should be noted, however, that, in accordance with the general spirit of this treatise, \textsection\textsection7--8 will be used less than the others, and in a less essential way; we have speak of Chevalley's schemes only to make the link with the language of Chevalley \cite{I-1} and Nagata \cite{I-9}.
Section \textsection9 gives definitions and results concerning quasi-coherent sheaves, some of which are no longer limited to a translation into a ``geometric'' language of known notions of commutative algebra, but are already of a global nature;
they will be indispensable, in the following chapters, for the global study of morphisms.
Finally, \textsection10 introduces a generalization of the notion of schemes, which will be used as an intermediary in Chapter~III to formulate and prove, in a convenient way, the fundamental results of the cohomological study of the proper morphisms;
moreover, it should be noted that the notion of formal schemes seems indispensable in expressing certain facts about the ``theory of modules'' (classification problems of algebraic varieties).
The results of \textsection10 will not be used before \textsection3 of Chapter~III, and it is recommended to omit their reading until then.
