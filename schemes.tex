The \textsection\textsection1--8 do little more than develop a language, which will be used in the following.
It should be noted, however, that in accordance with the general spirit of this treatise, \textsection\textsection7--8 will be used less than the others, and in a less essential way; we have moreover spoken of Chevalley's schemes only to make the link with the language of Chevalley \cite{I-1} and Nagata \cite{I-9}.
The \textsection9 gives definitions and results on quasi-coherent sheaves, some of which are no longer limited to a translation into a ``geometric'' language of known notions of commutative algebra, but are already of a global nature; they will be indispensable, in the following chapters, for the global study of morphisms.
Finally, \textsection10 introduces a generalization of the notion of schemes, which will be used as an intermediary in Chapter~III to formulate and prove in a convenient way the fundamental results of the cohomological study of the proper morphisms; moreover, it should be noted that the notion of formal schemes seems indispensable to express certain facts of the ``theory of modules'' (classification problems of algebraic varieties).
The results of \textsection10 will not be used before \textsection3 of Chapter~III and it is recommended to omit reading until then.
