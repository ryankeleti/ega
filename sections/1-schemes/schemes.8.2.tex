\begin{cx}{8.2.1}
    Let $X$ be an \emph{integral} prescheme, and $R$ its field of rational functions, identical to the local ring of the generic point $a$ of $X$; for all $x\in X$, we know that $\O_x$ can be canonically identified with a subring of $R$ (7.1.5), and for every rational function $f\in R$, the domain of definition $\delta(f)$ of $f$ is the open set of $x\in X$ such that $f\in\O_x$.
    It thus follows (7.2.6) that, for every open $U\subset X$, we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \Gamma(U,\O_X) = \bigcap_{x\in U}\O_x.\tag{8.2.1.1}
    \end{equation*}
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[Proposition]{8.2.2}
    \oldpage{166}Let $X$ be an integral prescheme, and $R$ its field of rational fractions.
    For $X$ to be a scheme, it is necessary and sufficient that the relation ``$\O_x$ and $\O_y$ are allied'' (8.1.4), for points $x,y$ of $X$, implies that $x=y$.
\end{cx}

Suppose that this condition is verified, and aim to show that $X$ is separated.
Let $U$ and $V$ be two distinct affine opens of $X$, with rings $A$ and $B$, identified with subrings of $R$; $U$ (resp. $V$) is thus identified (8.1.2) with $L(A)$ (resp. $L(B)$), and the hypothesis tells us (8.1.5) that $C$ is the subring of $R$ generated by $A\cup B$, and $W=U\cap V$ is identified with $L(A)\cap L(B)=L(C)$.
Further, we know ([1],~p.~\unsure{5-03},~prop.~4~\emph{bis}) that every subring $E$ of $R$ is equal to the intersection of the local rings belonging to $L(E)$; $C$ is thus identified with the intersection of the rings $\O_z$ for $z\in W$, or, equivalently (8.2.1.1) with $\Gamma(W,\O_X)$.
So consider the sub-prescheme induced by $X$ on $W$; to the \unsure{identity} morphism $\varphi\colon C\to\Gamma(W,\O_X)$ there corresponds (2.2.4) a morphism $\Phi=(\psi,\theta)\colon W\to\Spec(C)$; we will see that $\Phi$ is an \emph{isomorphism} of preschemes, whence $W$ is an \emph{affine} open.
The identification of $W$ with $L(C)=\Spec(C)$ shows that $\psi$ is \emph{bijective}.
On the other hand, for all $x\in W$, $\theta_x^\#$ is the injection $C_\mathfrak{r}\to\O_x$, where $\mathfrak{r}=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap C$, and by definition $C_\mathfrak{r}$ is identified with $\O_x$, so $\theta_x^\#$ is bijective.
It thus remains to show that $\psi$ is a \emph{homeomorphism}, i.e.\ that for every closed subset $F\subset W$, $\psi(F)$ is closed in $\Spec(C)$.
But $F$ is the \unsure{trace over} $W$ of closed subspace of $U$, of the form $V(\mathfrak{a})$, where $\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal of $A$; we show that $\psi(F)=V(\mathfrak{a}C)$, which proves our claim.
In fact, the prime ideals of $C$ containing $\mathfrak{a}C$ are the prime ideals of $C$ containing $\mathfrak{a}$, and so are the ideals of the form $\psi(x)=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap C$, where $\mathfrak{a}\subset\mathfrak{m}_x$ and $x\in W$; since $\mathfrak{a}\subset\mathfrak{m}_x$ is equivalent to $x\in V(\mathfrak{a})=W\cap F$ for $x\in U$, we do indeed have that $\psi(F)=V(\mathfrak{a}C)$.

It follows that $X$ is separated, because $U\cap V$ is affine and its ring $C$ is generated by the union $A\cup B$ of the rings of $U$ and $V$ (5.5.6).

Conversely, suppose that $X$ is separated, and let $x,y$ be two points of $X$ such that $\O_x$ and $\O_y$ are allied.
Let $U$ (resp. $V$) be an affine open containing $x$ (resp. $y$), of ring $A$ (resp. $B$); we then know that $U\cap V$ is affine and that its ring $C$ is generated by $A\cup B$ (5.5.6).
If $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap A$ and $\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{m}_y\cap B$, then $A_\mathfrak{p}=\O_x$ and $B_\mathfrak{q}=\O_y$, and since $A_\mathfrak{p}$ and $B_\mathfrak{q}$ are allied, there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{r}$ of $C$ such that $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{r}\cap A$ and $\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{r}\cap B$ (8.1.4).
But then there exists a point $z\in U\cap V$ such that $\mathfrak{r}=\mathfrak{m}_z\cap C$, since $U\cap V$ is affine, and so evidently $x=z$ and $y=z$, whence $x=y$.

\begin{cx}[Corollary]{8.2.3}
    Let $X$ be an integral scheme, and $x,y$ two points of $X$.
    In order that $x\in\overline{\{y\}}$, it is necessary and sufficient that $\O_x\subset\O_y$, or, equivalently, that every rational function defined at $x$ is also defined at $y$.
\end{cx}    

The condition is evidently necessary because the domain of definition $\delta(f)$ of a rational function $f\in R$ is open; we now show that it is sufficient.
If $\O_x\subset\O_y$, then there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\O_x$ such that $\O_y$ dominates $(\O_x)_\mathfrak{p}$ (8.1.3); but (2.4.2) there exists $z\in X$ such that $x\in\overline{\{z\}}$ and $\O_z=(\O_x)_\mathfrak{p}$; since $\O_z$ and $\O_y$ are allied, we have that $z=y$ by (8.2.2), whence the corollary.

\begin{cx}[Corollary]{8.2.4}
    If $X$ is an integral scheme then the map $x\to\O_x$ is injective; equivalently, if $x$ and $y$ are two distinct points of $X$, then there exists a rational function defined at one of these points but not the other.
\end{cx}

\oldpage{167}This follows from (8.2.3) and the axiom ($\mathrm{T}_0$) (2.1.4).

\begin{cx}[Corollary]{8.2.5}
    Let $X$ be an integral scheme whose underlying space is Noetherian; letting $f$ run over the field $R$ of rational functions on $X$, the sets $\delta(f)$ generate the topology of $X$.
\end{cx}

In fact, every closed subset of $X$ is thus a finite union of irreducible closed subsets, i.e. of the form $\overline{\{y\}}$ (2.1.5).
But, if $x\not\in\overline{\{y\}}$, then there exists a rational function $f$ defined at $x$ but not at $y$ (8.2.3), or, equivalently, we have that $x\in\delta(f)$ and $\delta(f)$ is not contained in $\overline{\{y\}}$.
The complement  of $\overline{\{y\}}$ is thus a union of sets of the form $\delta(f)$, and by virtue of the first remark, every open subset of $X$ is the union of finite intersections of open sets of the form $\delta(f)$.

\begin{cx}{8.2.6}
    Corollary~(8.2.5) shows that the topology of $X$ is entirely characterised by the data of the local rings $(\O_x)_{x\in X}$ that have $R$ as their field of fractions.
    It amounts to the same to say that the closed subsets of $X$ are defined in the following manner: given a finite subset $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ of $X$, consider the set of $y\in X$ such that $\O_y\subset\O_{x_i}$ for at least one index $i$, and these sets (over all choices of $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$) are the closed subsets of $X$.
    Further, once the topology on $X$ is known, the structure sheaf $\O_X$ is also determined by the family of the $\O_x$, since $\Gamma(U,\O_X)=\bigcap_{x\in U}\O_x$ by (8.2.1.1).
    The family $(\O_X)_{x\in X}$ thus completely determines the prescheme $X$ when $X$ is an integral scheme whose underlying space is Noetherian.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[Proposition]{8.2.7}
    Let $X,Y$ be two integral schemes, $f\colon X\to Y$ a dominant morphism (2.2.6), and $K$ (resp. $L$) the field of rational functions on $X$ (resp. $Y$).
    Then $L$ can be identified with a sub-field of $K$, and for all $x\in X$, $\O_{f(x)}$ is the unique local ring of $Y$ dominated by $\O_x$.
\end{cx}

In fact, if $f=(\psi,\theta)$ and $a$ is the generic point of $X$, then $\psi(a)$ is the generic point of $Y$ (\textbf{0},~2.1.5); $\theta_a^\#$ is then a monomorphism of fields, from $L=\O_{\psi(a)}$ to $K=\O_a$.
Since every non-empty affine open $U$ of $Y$ contains $\psi(a)$, it follows from (2.2.4) that the homomorphism $\Gamma(U,\O_Y)\to\Gamma(\psi^{-1}(U),\O_X)$ corresponding to $f$ is the restriction of $\theta_a^\#$ to $\Gamma(U,\O_Y)$.
So, for every $x\in X$, $\theta_x^\#$ is the restriction to $\O_{\psi(a)}$ of $\theta_a^\#$, and is thus a monomorphism.
We also know that $\theta_x^\#$ is a local homomorphism, so, if we identify $L$ with a sub-field of $K$ by $\theta_a^\#$, $\O_{\psi(x)}$ is dominated by $\O_x$ (8.1.1); it is also the only local ring of $Y$ dominated by $\O_x$, since two local rings of $Y$ that are allied are identical (8.2.2).

\begin{cx}[Proposition]{8.2.8}
    Let $X$ be an \emph{irreducible} prescheme; and $f\colon X\to Y$ a local immersion (\emph{resp.} a local isomorphism); and suppose further that $f$ is separated.
    Then $f$ is an immersion (\emph{resp.} an open immersion).
\end{cx}

Let $f=(\psi,\theta)$; it suffices, in both cases, to prove that $\psi$ is a \emph{homeomorphism} from $X$ to $\psi(X)$ (4.5.3).
Replacing $f$ by $f_\mathrm{red}$ (5.1.6 and 5.5.1,~(vi)), we can assume that $X$ and $Y$ are \emph{reduced}.
If $Y'$ is the closed reduced sub-prescheme of $Y$ having $\overline{\psi(X)}$ as its underlying space, then $f$ factorises as $X\xrightarrow{f'}Y'\xrightarrow{j}Y$, where $j$ is the canonical injection (5.2.2).
It follows from (5.5.1,~(v)) that $f'$ is again a separated morphism; further, $f'$ is again \oldpage{168}a local immersion (resp. a local isomorphism), because, since the condition is local on $X$ and $Y$, we can reduce ourselves to the case where $f$ is a closed immersion (resp. open immersion), and then our claim follows immediately from (4.2.2).

We can thus suppose that $f$ is a \emph{dominant} morphism, which leads to the fact that $Y$ is, itself, irreducible (\textbf{0},~2.1.5), and so $X$ and $Y$ are both \emph{integral}.
Further, the condition being local on $Y$, we can suppose that $Y$ is an affine scheme; since $f$ is separated, $X$ is a scheme (5.5.1,~(ii)), and we are finally at the hypotheses of (8.2.7).
Then, for all $x\in X$, $\theta_x^\#$ is injective; but the hypothesis that $F$ is a local immersion implies that $\theta_x^\#$ is surjective (4.2.2), so $\theta_x^\#$ is bijective, or, equivalently (with the identification of (8.2.7)) we have that $\O_{\psi(x)}=\O_x$.
This implies, by (8.2.4), that $\psi$ is an \emph{injective} map, which already proves the proposition when $f$ is a local isomorphism (4.5.3).
When we suppose that $f$ is only a local immersion, for all $x\in X$ there exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$ and an open neighbourhood $V$ of $\psi(x)$ in $Y$ such that the restriction of $\psi$ to $U$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ to a \emph{closed} subset of $V$.
But $U$ is dense in $X$, so $\psi(U)$ is dense in $Y$ and \emph{a fortiori} in $V$, which proves that $\psi(U)=V$; since $\psi$ is injective, $\psi^{-1}(V)=U$ and this proves that $\psi$ is a homeomorphism from $X$ to $\psi(X)$.
