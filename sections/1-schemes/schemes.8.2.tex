\begin{cx}{8.2.1}
    Let $X$ be an \emph{integral} prescheme, and $R$ its field of rational functions, identical to the local ring of the generic point $a$ of $X$; for all $x\in X$, we know that $\O_x$ can be canonically identified with a subring of $R$ (7.1.5), and for every rational function $f\in R$, the domain of definition $\delta(f)$ of $f$ is the open set of $x\in X$ such that $f\in\O_x$.
    It thus follows (7.2.6) that, for every open $U\subset X$, we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \Gamma(U,\O_X) = \bigcap_{x\in U}\O_x.\tag{8.2.1.1}
    \end{equation*}
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[Proposition]{8.2.2}
    \oldpage{166}Let $X$ be an integral prescheme, and $R$ its field of rational fractions.
    For $X$ to be a scheme, it is necessary and sufficient that the relation ``$\O_x$ and $\O_y$ are allied'' (8.1.4), for points $x,y$ of $X$, implies that $x=y$.
\end{cx}

Suppose that this condition is verified, and aim to show that $X$ is separated.
Let $U$ and $V$ be two distinct affine opens of $X$, with rings $A$ and $B$, identified with subrings of $R$; $U$ (resp. $V$) is thus identified (8.1.2) with $L(A)$ (resp. $L(B)$), and the hypothesis tells us (8.1.5) that $C$ is the subring of $R$ generated by $A\cup B$, and $W=U\cap V$ is identified with $L(A)\cap L(B)=L(C)$.
Further, we know ([1],~p.~\unsure{5-03},~prop.~4~\emph{bis}) that every subring $E$ of $R$ is equal to the intersection of the local rings belonging to $L(E)$; $C$ is thus identified with the intersection of the rings $\O_z$ for $z\in W$, or, equivalently (8.2.1.1) with $\Gamma(W,\O_X)$.
So consider the sub-prescheme induced by $X$ on $W$; to the \unsure{identity} morphism $\varphi\colon C\to\Gamma(W,\O_X)$ there corresponds (2.2.4) a morphism $\Phi=(\psi,\theta)\colon W\to\Spec(C)$; we will see that $\Phi$ is an \emph{isomorphism} of preschemes, whence $W$ is an \emph{affine} open.
The identification of $W$ with $L(C)=\Spec(C)$ shows that $\psi$ is \emph{bijective}.
On the other hand, for all $x\in W$, $\theta_x^\#$ is the injection $C_\mathfrak{r}\to\O_x$, where $\mathfrak{r}=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap C$, and by definition $C_\mathfrak{r}$ is identified with $\O_x$, so $\theta_x^\#$ is bijective.
It thus remains to show that $\psi$ is a \emph{homeomorphism}, i.e.\ that for every closed subset $F\subset W$, $\psi(F)$ is closed in $\Spec(C)$.
But $F$ is the \unsure{trace over} $W$ of closed subspace of $U$, of the form $V(\mathfrak{a})$, where $\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal of $A$; we show that $\psi(F)=V(\mathfrak{a}C)$, which proves our claim.
In fact, the prime ideals of $C$ containing $\mathfrak{a}C$ are the prime ideals of $C$ containing $\mathfrak{a}$, and so are the ideals of the form $\psi(x)=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap C$, where $\mathfrak{a}\subset\mathfrak{m}_x$ and $x\in W$; since $\mathfrak{a}\subset\mathfrak{m}_x$ is equivalent to $x\in V(\mathfrak{a})=W\cap F$ for $x\in U$, we do indeed have that $\psi(F)=V(\mathfrak{a}C)$.

It follows that $X$ is separated, because $U\cap V$ is affine and its ring $C$ is generated by the union $A\cup B$ of the rings of $U$ and $V$ (5.5.6).

Conversely, suppose that $X$ is separated, and let $x,y$ be two points of $X$ such that $\O_x$ and $\O_y$ are allied.
Let $U$ (resp. $V$) be an affine open containing $x$ (resp. $y$), of ring $A$ (resp. $B$); we then know that $U\cap V$ is affine and that its ring $C$ is generated by $A\cup B$ (5.5.6).
If $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{m}_x\cap A$ and $\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{m}_y\cap B$, then $A_\mathfrak{p}=\O_x$ and $B_\mathfrak{q}=\O_y$, and since $A_\mathfrak{p}$ and $B_\mathfrak{q}$ are allied, there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{r}$ of $C$ such that $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{r}\cap A$ and $\mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{r}\cap B$ (8.1.4).
But then there exists a point $z\in U\cap V$ such that $\mathfrak{r}=\mathfrak{m}_z\cap C$, since $U\cap V$ is affine, and so evidently $x=z$ and $y=z$, whence $x=y$.

\begin{cx}[Corollary]{8.2.3}
    Let $X$ be an integral scheme, and $x,y$ two points of $X$.
    In order that $x\in\overline{\{y\}}$, it is necessary and sufficient that $\O_x\subset\O_y$, or, equivalently, that every rational function defined at $x$ is also defined at $y$.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[Corollary]{8.2.4}
    If $X$ is an integral scheme then the map $x\to\O_x$ is injective; equivalently, if $x$ and $y$ are two distinct points of $X$, then there exists a rational function defined at one of these points but not the other.
\end{cx}

\oldpage{167}This follows from (8.2.3) and the axiom ($\mathrm{T}_0$) (2.1.4).

\begin{cx}[Corollary]{8.2.5}
    Let $X$ be an integral scheme whose underlying space is Noetherian; letting $f$ run over the field $R$ of rational functions on $X$, the sets $\delta(f)$ generate the topology of $X$.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{8.2.6}
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[Proposition]{8.2.7}
    Let $X,Y$ be two integral schemes, $f\colon X\to Y$ a dominant morphism (2.2.6), and $K$ (resp. $L$) the field of rational functions on $X$ (resp. $Y$).
    Then $L$ can be identified with a sub-field of $K$, and for all $x\in X$, $\O_{f(x)}$ is the unique local ring of $Y$ dominated by $\O_x$.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[Proposition]{8.2.8}
    Let $X$ be an \emph{irreducible} prescheme; and $f\colon X\to Y$ a local immersion (\emph{resp.} a local isomorphism); and suppose further that $f$ is separated.
    Then $f$ is an immersion (\emph{resp.} an open immersion).
