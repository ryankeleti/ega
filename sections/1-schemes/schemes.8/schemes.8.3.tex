Let $X$ be a \emph{Noetherian} integral scheme, and $R$ its
field of rational functions; we denote by $X'$ the set of local subrings
$\O_x\subset R$, where $x$ runs over all points of $X$. The set $X'$ verifies
the three following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(Sch. 1)] For all $M\in X'$, $R$ is the field of fractions of $M$.
  \item[(Sch. 2)] There exists a finite set of Noetherian subrings $A_i$ of $R$
  such that $X'=\bigcup_i L(A_i)$, and, for all pairs of indices $i,j$, the subring
  $A_{ij}$ of $R$ generated by $A_i\cup A_j$ is an algebra of finite type over $A_i$.
  \item[(Sch. 3)] Two elements $M$ and $N$ of $X'$ that are allied are identical.
\end{itemize}
\end{env}

We have basically seen in \eref{8.2.1} that (Sch.~1) is satisfied, and (Sch.~3)
follows from \eref{8.2.2}. To show (Sch.~2), it suffices to cover $X$ by a
finite number of affine opens $U_i$, whose rings are Noetherian, and to take
$A_i=\Gamma(U_i,\O_X)$; the hypothesis that $X$ is a scheme implies that
$U_i\cap U_j$ is affine, and also that $\Gamma(U_i\cap U_j,\O_X)=A_{ij}$
\eref{5.5.6}; further, since the space $U_i$ is Noetherian, the immersion
$U_i\cap U_j\to U_i$ is of finite type \eref{6.3.5}, so $A_{ij}$ is an
$A_i$-algebra of finite type \eref{6.3.3}.

\begin{env}{8.3.2}
\label{env-1.8.3.2}
The structures whose axioms are (Sch.~1), (Sch.~2), and
(Sch.~3), generalise ``schemes'' in the sense of C.~Chevalley, who supposes
furthermore that $R$ is an extension of finite type of a field $K$, and that the
$A_i$ are $K$-algebras of finite type (which renders a part of (Sch.~2) useless)
[1]. Conversely, if we have such a structure on a set $X'$, then we can
associate to it an integral scheme $X$ by using the remarks from \eref{8.2.6}:
the underlying space of $X$ is equal to $X'$ endowed with the topology defined
in \eref{8.2.6}, and with the sheaf $\O_X$ such that
$\Gamma(U,\O_X)=\bigcap_{x\in U}\O_x$ for all open $U\subset X$, with the
evident definition of restriction homomorphisms. We leave to the reader the
task of verifying that we obtain thusly an integral scheme, whose local rings
are the elements of $X'$; we will not use this result in what follows.
