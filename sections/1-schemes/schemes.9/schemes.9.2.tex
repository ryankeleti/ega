\begin{cx}[Proposition]{9.2.1}
    Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism of preschemes.
    We suppose that there exists a cover $(Y_\alpha)$ of $Y$ by affine opens having the following property: every $f^{-1}(Y_\alpha)$ admits a \emph{finite} cover $(X_{\alpha i})$ by affine opens contained in $f^{-1}(Y_\alpha)$ such that every intersection $X_{\alpha i}\cap X_{\alpha j}$ is itself a \emph{finite} union of affine opens.
    With these hypotheses, for every quasi-coherent $\O_X$-module $\mathscr{F}$, $f_*(\mathscr{F})$ is a quasi-coherent $\O_Y$-module.
