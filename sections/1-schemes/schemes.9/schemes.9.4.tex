\begin{env}{9.4.1}
Let\oldpage{174} $X$ be a topological space, $\sheaf{F}$ a
sheaf of sets (resp.of groups, of rings) on $X$, $U$ an open subset of $X$,
$\psi\colon U\to X$ the canonical injection, and $\sheaf{G}$ a subsheaf of
$\sheaf{F}|U=\psi^\ast(\sheaf{F})$. Since $\psi_\ast$ is left exact,
$\psi_\ast(\sheaf{G})$ is a subsheaf of $\psi_\ast(\psi^\ast(\sheaf{F}))$; if we denote
by $\rho$ the canonical homomorphism $\sheaf{F}\to\psi_\ast(\psi^\ast(\sheaf{F}))$
(\textbf{0},~3.5.3), then we denote by $\overline{\sheaf{G}}$ the subsheaf
$\rho^{-1}(\psi_\ast(\sheaf{G}))$ of $\sheaf{F}$. It follows immediately from the
definitions that, for every open subset $V$ of $X$,
$\Gamma(V,\overline{\sheaf{G}})$ consists of sections $s\in\Gamma(V,\sheaf{F})$
whose restriction to $V\cap U$ is a section of $\sheaf{G}$ over $V\cap U$. We
thus have that $\overline{\sheaf{G}}|U=\psi^\ast(\overline{\sheaf{G}})=\sheaf{G}$,
and that $\overline{\sheaf{G}}$ is the \emph{biggest} subsheaf of $\sheaf{F}$
that restricts to $\sheaf{G}$ over $U$; we say that $\overline{\sheaf{G}}$ is
the \emph{canonical extension} of the subsheaf $\sheaf{G}$ of $\sheaf{F}|U$ to a
subsheaf of $\sheaf{F}$.
\end{env}

\begin{env}[Proposition]{9.4.2}
Let $X$ be a prescheme, $U$ an open subset of $X$ such that the canonical injection
$j\colon U\to X$ is a quasicompact morphism \emph{(which will be the case for
\emph{all} $U$ if the underlying space of $X$ is \emph{locally Noetherian}
{\normalfont(\eref{6.6.4},~(i))})}. Then:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(i)] For every quasicoherent $(\O_X|U)$-module $\sheaf{G}$, $j_\ast(\sheaf{G})$
             is a quasicoherent $\O_X$-module, and
             $j_\ast(\sheaf{G})|U=j^\ast(j_\ast(\sheaf{G}))=\sheaf{G}$.
  \item[(ii)] For every quasicoherent $\O_X$-module $\sheaf{F}$ and every quasicoherent
              $(\O_X|U)$-submodule $\sheaf{G}$, the canonical extension
              $\overline{\sheaf{G}}$ of $\sheaf{G}$ {\normalfont(9.4.1)} is a
              quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodule of $\sheaf{F}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{env}

If $j=(\psi,\theta)$ ($\psi$ being the injection $U\to X$ of underlying spaces),
then by definition we have that $j_\ast(\sheaf{G})=\psi_\ast(\sheaf{G})$ for every
$(\O_X|U)$-module $\sheaf{G}$, and, further, that
$j^\ast(\sheaf{H})=\psi^\ast(\sheaf{H})=\sheaf{H}|U$ for every $\O_X$-module
$\sheaf{H}$, by definition of the prescheme induced over an open subset. So (i)
is thus a particular case of (\eref{9.2.2},~\emph{a})); for the same reason,
$j_\ast(j^\ast(\sheaf{F}))$ is quasicoherent, and since $\overline{\sheaf{G}}$ is the
inverse image of $j_\ast(\sheaf{G})$ by the homomorphism $\rho\colon\sheaf{F}\to
j_\ast(j^\ast(\sheaf{F}))$, (ii) follows from \eref{4.1.1}.
 
Note that the hypothesis that the morphism $j\colon U\to X$ is quasicompact
holds whenever the open subset $U$ is \emph{quasicompact} and $X$ is a
\emph{scheme}: indeed, $U$ is then a union of finitely-many affine opens $U_i$,
and for every affine open $V$ of $X$, $V\cap U_i$ is an affine open \eref{5.5.6}, and
thus quasicompact.
 
\begin{env}[Corollary]{9.4.3}
Let $X$ be a prescheme, $U$ a quasicompact open
subset of $X$ such that the injection morphism $j\colon U\to X$ is
quasicompact.Suppose as well that every quasicoherent $\O_X$-module is the
inductive limit of its quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodules of finite type
\emph{(which will be the case if $X$ is an \emph{affine scheme})}. Then let
$\sheaf{F}$ be a quasicoherent $\O_X$-module, and $\sheaf{G}$ a quasicoherent
$(\O_X|U)$-submodule \emph{of finite type} of $\sheaf{F}|U$.Then there exists
a quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodule $\sheaf{G}'$ of $\sheaf{F}$ \emph{of finite
type} such that $\sheaf{G}'|U=\sheaf{G}$.
\end{env}
 
Indeed, we have $\sheaf{G}=\overline{\sheaf{G}}|U$, and $\overline{\sheaf{G}}$
is quasicoherent, from \eref{9.4.2}, and so the inductive limit of its
quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodules $\sheaf{H}_\lambda$ of finite type. It
follows that $\sheaf{G}$ is the inductive limit of the $\sheaf{H}_\lambda|U$,
and thus equal to one of the $\sheaf{H}_\lambda|U$ since it is of finite type
(\textbf{0},~5.2.3).
 
\begin{env}[Remark]{9.4.4}
Suppose that for \emph{every} affine open $U\subset
X$, the injection morphism $U\to X$ is quasicompact.Then, if the conclusion
of \eref{9.4.3} holds for every affine open $U$ and every quasicoherent
$(\O_X|U)$-submodule $\sheaf{G}$ of $\sheaf{F}|U$ of finite type, it
follows\oldpage{175} that $\sheaf{F}$ is the inductive limit of its
quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodules of finite type.Indeed, for every affine open
$U\subset X$, we have that $\sheaf{F}|U=\widetilde{M}$, where $M$ is an
$A(U)$-module, and since the latter is the inductive limit of its quasicoherent
submodules of finite type, $\sheaf{F}|U$ is the inductive limit of its
$(\O_X|U)$-submodules of finite type \eref{1.3.9}.But, by hypothesis, each of
these submodules is induced on $U$ by a quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodule
$\sheaf{G}_{\lambda,U}$ of $\sheaf{F}$ of finite type.The finite sums of the
$\sheaf{G}_{\lambda,U}$ are again quasicoherent $\O_X$-modules of finite type,
because the property is local, and the case where $X$ is affine was covered in
\eref{1.3.10}; it is clear then that $\sheaf{F}$ is the inductive limit of these
finite sums, whence our claim.
\end{env}
 
\begin{env}[Corollary]{9.4.5}
Under the hypotheses of \eref{9.4.3}, for every quasicoherent $(\O_X|U)$-module
$\sheaf{G}$ of finite type, there exists a quasicoherent $\O_X$-module
$\sheaf{G}'$ of finite type such that $\sheaf{G}'|U=\sheaf{G}$.
\end{env}

Since $\sheaf{F}=j_\ast(\sheaf{G})$ is quasicoherent \eref{9.4.2} and
$\sheaf{F}|U=\sheaf{G}$, it suffices to apply \eref{9.4.3} to $\sheaf{F}$.

\begin{env}[Lemma]{9.4.6}
Let $X$ be a prescheme, $L$ a well-ordered set,$(V_\lambda)_{\lambda\in L}$ a cover
of $X$ by affine opens, and $U$ an open of
$X$; for all $\lambda\in L$, we set $W_\lambda=\bigcup_{\mu<\lambda}V_\mu$.
Suppose that: (1) for every $\lambda\in L$, $V_\lambda\cap W_\lambda$ is
quasicompact; (2) the immersion morphism $U\to X$ is quasicompact.Then, for
every quasicoherent $\O_X$-module $\sheaf{F}$ and every quasicoherent
$(\O_X|U)$-submodule $\sheaf{G}$ of $\sheaf{F}|U$ \emph{of finite type}, there
exists a quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodule $\sheaf{G}'$ of $\sheaf{F}$ \emph{of
finite type} such that $\sheaf{G}'|U=\sheaf{G}$.
\end{env}

Let $U_\lambda=U\cup W_\lambda$; we will define a family $(\sheaf{G}'_\lambda)$
by recurrence, where $\sheaf{G}'_\lambda$ is a quasicoherent
$(\O_X|U_\lambda)$-submodule of $\sheaf{F}|U_\lambda$ of finite type, such that
$\sheaf{G}'_\lambda|U_\mu=\sheaf{G}'_\mu$ for $\mu<\lambda$ and
$\sheaf{G}'_\lambda|U=\sheaf{G}$. The unique $\O_X$-submodule $\sheaf{G}'$ of
$\sheaf{F}$ such that $\sheaf{G}'|U_\lambda=\sheaf{G}'$ for all $\lambda\in L$
(\textbf{0},~3.3.1) gives us what we want. So suppose that the $\sheaf{G}'_\mu$
are defined and have the preceding properties for $\mu<\lambda$; if $\lambda$
does not have a predecessor then we take for $\sheaf{G}'_\lambda$ the unique
$(\O_X|U_\lambda)$-submodule of $\sheaf{F}|U_\lambda$ such that
$\sheaf{G}'_\lambda|U_\mu=\sheaf{G}'_\mu$ for all $\mu<\lambda$, which is
allowed since the $U_\mu$ with $\mu<\lambda$ then form a cover of $U_\lambda$.
If, conversely, $\lambda=\mu+1$, then $U_\lambda=U_\mu\cup V_\mu$, and it
suffices to define a quasicoherent $(\O_X|V_\mu)$-submodule $\sheaf{G}''_\mu$
of $\sheaf{F}|V_\mu$ of finite type such that
\[
  \sheaf{G}''_\mu|(U_\mu\cap V_\mu)=\sheaf{G}'_\mu|(U_\mu\cap V_\mu);
\]
and then to take for $\sheaf{G}'_\lambda$ the
$(\O_X|U_\lambda)$-submodule of $\sheaf{F}|U_\lambda$ such that
$\sheaf{G}'_\lambda|U_\mu=\sheaf{G}'_\mu$ and
$\sheaf{G}'_\lambda|V_\mu=\sheaf{G}''_\mu$ (\textbf{0},~3.3.1). But, since
$V_\mu$ is affine, the existence of $\sheaf{G}''_\mu$ is guaranteed by \eref{9.4.3}
as soon as we show that $U_\mu\cap V_\mu$ is quasicompact; but $U_\mu\cap
V_\mu$ is the union of $U\cap V_\mu$ and $W_\mu\cap V_\mu$, which are both
quasicompact by virtue of the hypothesis.


\begin{env}[Theorem]{9.4.7}
Let $X$ be a prescheme, and $U$ an open of $X$.
Suppose that one of the following conditions is verified:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] the underlying space of $X$ is locally Noetherian;
  \item[(b)] $X$ is a quasicompact scheme and $U$ is a quasicompact open.
\end{itemize}
Then, for every quasicoherent $\O_X$-module $\sheaf{F}$ and every quasicoherent
$(\O_X|U)$-submodule $\sheaf{G}$ of $\sheaf{F}|U$ \emph{of finite type}, there exists a
quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodule $\sheaf{G}'$ of $\sheaf{F}$ \emph{of finite type}
such that $\sheaf{G}'|U=\sheaf{G}$.
\end{env}

Let\oldpage{176} $(V_\lambda)_{\lambda\in L}$ be a cover of $X$ by affine opens,
with $L$ supposed finite in case \emph{(b)}; since $L$ is equipped with the
structure of a well-ordered set, it suffices to verify that the conditions of
\eref{9.4.6} are satisfied.It is clear in the case of \emph{(a)}, as the spaces
$V_\lambda$ are Noetherian.For case \emph{(b)}, the $V_\lambda\cap\lambda_\mu$
are affine \eref{5.5.6}, and thus quasicompact, and since $L$ is finite,
$V_\lambda\cap W_\lambda$ is quasicompact.Whence the theorem.

\begin{env}[Corollary]{9.4.8}
Under the hypotheses of \eref{9.4.7}, for every quasicoherent $(\O_X|U)$-module
$\sheaf{G}$ of finite type, there exists a quasicoherent $\O_X$-module $\sheaf{G}'$
of finite type such that $\sheaf{G}'|U=\sheaf{G}$.
\end{env}

It suffices to apply \eref{9.4.7} to $\sheaf{F}=j_\ast(\sheaf{G})$, which is
quasicoherent \eref{9.4.2} and such that $\sheaf{F}|U=\sheaf{G}$.

\begin{env}[Corollary]{9.4.9}
Let $X$ be a prescheme whose underlying space is locally Noetherian, or a
quasicompact scheme. Then every quasicoherent $\O_X$-module is the inductive limit
of its quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodules of finite type.
\end{env}

This follows from \eref{9.4.7} and the remark \eref{9.4.4}.

\begin{env}[Corollary]{9.4.10}
Under the hypotheses of \eref{9.4.9}, if a quasicoherent $\O_X$-module $\sheaf{F}$
is such that every quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodule of finite type of $\sheaf{F}$ is
generated by its sections over $X$, then $\sheaf{F}$ is generated by its sections
over $X$.
\end{env}

In fact, let $U$ be an affine open neighbourhood of a point $x\in X$, and let
$s$ be a section of $\sheaf{F}$ over $U$; the $\O_X$-submodule $\sheaf{G}$ of
$\sheaf{F}|U$ generated by $s$ is quasicoherent and of finite type, so there
exists a quasicoherent $\O_X$-submodule $\sheaf{G}'$ of $\sheaf{F}$ of finite
type such that $\sheaf{G}'|U=\sheaf{G}$ \eref{9.4.7}.By hypothesis, there is thus a
finite number of sections $t_i$ of $\sheaf{G}'$ over $X$ and of sections $a_i$
of $\O_X$ over a neighbourhood $V\subset U$ of $x$ such that
$s|V=\sum_i a_i(t_i|V)$, which proves the corollary.
