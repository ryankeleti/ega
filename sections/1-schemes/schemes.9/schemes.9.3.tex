\begin{env}[Theorem]{9.3.1} Let $X$ be a prescheme whose underlying space is
Noetherian, or a scheme whose underlying space is quasicompact.  Let
$\sheaf{L}$ be an invertible $\O_X$-module {\normalfont(\textbf{0},~5.4.1)}, $f$
a section of $\sheaf{L}$ over $X$, $X_f$ the open set of $x\in X$ such that
$f(x)\neq0$ {\normalfont(\textbf{0},~5.5.1)}, and $\sheaf{F}$ a quasicoherent
$\O_X$-module.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(i)] If
$s\in\Gamma(X,\sheaf{F})$ is such that $s|X_f=0$, then there exists a whole
number $n>0$ such that $s\otimes f^{\otimes n}=0$.
  \item[(ii)] For every section
$s\in\Gamma(X_f,\sheaf{F})$, there exists a whole number $n>0$ such that
$s\otimes f^{\otimes n}$ extends to a section of
$\sheaf{F}\otimes\sheaf{L}^{\otimes n}$ over $X$.
\end{itemize}
\end{env}

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Since the underlying
space of $X$ is quasicompact, and thus the union of finitely-many affine opens
$U_i$ with $\sheaf{L}|U_i$ is isomorphic to $\O_X|U_i$, we can reduce to the
case where $X$ is affine and $\sheaf{L}=\O_X$.  In this case, $f$ is identified
with an element of $A(X)$, and we have that $X_f=D(f)$; $s$ is identified with
an element of an $A(X)$-module $M$, and $s|X_f$ to the corresponding element of
$M_f$, and the result is then trivial, recalling the definition of a module of
fractions.
\item[(ii)] Again\oldpage{173}, $X$ is a finite union of affine opens
$U_i$ ($1\leq i\leq r$) such that $\sheaf{L}|U_i\cong\O_X|U_i$, and for every
$i$, $(s\otimes f^{\otimes n})|(U_i\cap X_f)$ is identified (by the
aforementioned isomorphism) with $(f|(U_i\cap X_f))^n(s|(U_i\cap X_f))$.  We
then know \eref{1.4.1} that there exists a whole number $n>0$ such that, for all
$i$, $(s\otimes f^{\otimes n})|(U_i\cap X_f)$ extends to a section $s_i$ of
$\sheaf{F}\otimes\sheaf{L}^{\otimes n}$ over $U_i$.  Let $s_{i|j}$ be the
restriction of $s_i$ to $U_i\cap U_j$; by definition we have that
$s_{i|j}-s_{j|i}=0$ in $X_f\cap U_i\cap U_j$.  But, if $X$ is a Noetherian
space, then $U_i\cap U_j$ is quasicompact; if $X$ is a scheme, then $U_i\cap
U_j$ is an affine open \eref{5.5.6}, and so again quasicompact.  By virtue of
(i), there thus exists a whole number $m$ (independent of $i$ and $j$) such that
$(s_{i|j}-s_{j|i})\otimes f^{\otimes m}=0$.  It immediately follows that there
exists a section $s'$ of $\sheaf{F}\otimes\sheaf{L}^{\otimes(n+m)}$ over $X$,
restricting to $s_i\otimes f^{\otimes m}$ over each $U_i$, and restricting to
$s\otimes f^{\otimes(n+m)}$ over $X_f$.
\end{itemize}

The following
corollaries give an interpretation of theorem \eref{9.3.1} in a more algebraic
language:

\begin{env}[Corollary]{9.3.2} With the hypotheses of {\normalfont(9.3.1)},
consider the graded ring $A_\ast=\Gamma_\ast(\sheaf{L})$ and the graded
$A_\ast$-module $M_\ast=\Gamma_\ast(\sheaf{L},\sheaf{F})$
{\normalfont(\textbf{0},~5.4.6)}.  If $f\in A_n$, where $n\in\Z$, then there is
a canonical isomorphism $\Gamma(X_f,\sheaf{F})\xrightarrow{\sim}((M_\ast)_f)_0$
(\emph{the subgroup of the module of fractions $(M_\ast)_f$ consisting of
elements of degree $0$}).
\end{env}

\begin{env}[Corollary]{9.3.3} Suppose that
the hypotheses of \eref{9.3.1} are satisfied, and suppose further that
$\sheaf{L}=\O_X$.  Then, setting $A=\Gamma(X,\O_X)$ and $M=\Gamma(X,\sheaf{F})$,
the $A_f$-module $\Gamma(X_f,\sheaf{F})$ is canonically isomorphic to $M_f$.
\end{env}

\begin{env}[Proposition]{9.3.4} Let $X$ be a Noetherian prescheme,
$\sheaf{F}$ a coherent $\O_X$-module, and $\sheaf{J}$ a coherent sheaf of ideals
in $\O_X$, such that the support of $\sheaf{F}$ is contained in that of
$\O_X|\sheaf{J}$.  Then there exists a whole number $n>0$ such that
$\sheaf{J}^n\sheaf{F}=0$.
\end{env}

Since $X$ is a union of finitely-many affine opens whose rings are Noetherian,
we can suppose that $X$ is affine of Noetherian ring $A$; then
$\sheaf{F}=\widetilde{M}$, where $M=\Gamma(X,\sheaf{F})$ is an $A$-module of
finite type, and $\sheaf{J}=\widetilde{\mathfrak{J}}$, where
$\mathfrak{J}=\Gamma(X,\sheaf{J})$ is an ideal of $A$ (\eref{1.4.1} and
\eref{1.5.1}).  Since $A$ is Noetherian, $\mathfrak{J}$ admits a finite system
of generators $f_i$ ($1\leq i\leq m$).  By hypothesis, every section of
$\sheaf{F}$ over $X$ is zero in each of the $D(f_i)$; if $s_j$ ($1\leq j\leq q$)
are sections of $\sheaf{F}$ generating $M$, then there exists a whole number
$h$, independent of $i$ and $j$, such that $f_i^h s_j=0$. \eref{1.4.1}, whence
$f_i^h s=0$ for all $s\in M$.  We thus conclude that if $n=mh$ then
$\mathfrak{J}^n M=0$, and so the corresponding $\O_X$-module
$\sheaf{J}^n\sheaf{F}=\widetilde{\mathfrak{J}^n M}$ \eref{1.3.13} is zero.

\begin{env}[Corollary]{9.3.5} With the hypotheses of \eref{9.3.4}, there exists
a closed subprescheme $Y$ of $X$, whose underlying space is the support of
$\O_X/\sheaf{J}$, such that, if $j\colon Y\to X$ is the canonical injection,
then $\sheaf{F}=j_\ast(j^\ast(\sheaf{F}))$.
\end{env}

First of all, note that the supports of $\O_X/\sheaf{J}$ and $\O_X/\sheaf{J}^n$
are the same, since, if $\sheaf{J}_x=\O_x$, then $\sheaf{J}_x^n=\O_x$, and we
also have that $\sheaf{J}_x^n\subset\sheaf{J}_x$ for all $x\in X$.  We can,
thanks to \eref{9.3.4}, thus suppose that $\sheaf{J}\sheaf{F}=0$; we can then
take $Y$ to be the closed subprescheme of $X$ defined by $\sheaf{J}$, and since
$\sheaf{F}$ is then an $(\O_X/\sheaf{J})$-module, the conclusion follows
immediately.
