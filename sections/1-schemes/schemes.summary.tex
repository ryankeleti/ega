\oldpage{79}The \textsection\textsection 1-8 do little more than develop a language, which will be used in the following.
It should be noted, however, that in accordance with the general spirit of this Treaty, \textsection\textsection
7-8 will be used less than the others, and in a less essential way; we have moreover spoken of Chevalley's schemes
only to make the link with the language of Chevalley [1] and Nagata [9]. The \textsection 9 gives definitions and results
on quasi-coherent sheaves, some of which are no longer limited to a translation into a ``geometric'' language of known notions
of commutative algebra, but are already of a global nature; they will be indispensable, from the following chapters,
in the global study of morphisms. Finally, \textsection 10 introduces a generalization of the notion of schemes, which will
be used as an intermediary in Chapter III to formulate and demonstrate in a convenient way the fundamental results of the
cohomological study of the proper morphisms; moreover, it should be noted that the notion of formal schemes seems indispensable
to express certain facts of the ``theory of modules'' (classification problems of algebraic varieties). The results of
\textsection 10 will not be used before \textsection 3 of Chapter III and it is recommended to omit reading until then.
