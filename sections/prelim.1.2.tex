\begin{cx}[1.2.1]
We say that a part $S$ of a ring $A$ is \emph{multiplicative} if $1\in S$ and if the product of two elements of
$S$ is in $S$. The examples which will be the most important for the following are:
\nth{1} the set $S_f$ of powers $f^n$ ($n\geq 0$) of an element $f\in A$;
\nth{2} the complement $A-\mf{p}$ of a \emph{prime} ideal $\mf{p}$ of $A$.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[1.2.2]
Let $S$ be a multiplicative part of a ring $A$, $M$ an $A$-module; in the set $M\times S$, the relation between
couples $(m_1,s_1)$, $(m_2,s_2)$:
\[
   ``\text{There exists } s\in S\text{ such that } s(s_1 m_2-s_2 m_1)=0"
\]
is an equivalence relation. We denote by $S^{-1}M$ the quotient set of $M\times S$ by this relation, by $m/s$ the canonical
image in $S^{-1}M$ of the pair $(m,s)$; we call the \emph{canonical} mapping of $M$ in $S^{-1}M$ the mapping $i_M^S:m\mapsto m/1$
(also denoted $i^S$). This mapping is generally neither injective nor surjective; its kernel is the set of $m\in M$ such that there
exists an $s\in S$ for which $sm=0$.

In $S^{-1}M$ we define an additive group law by taking
\[
  (m_1/s_1)+(m_2/s_2)=(s_2 m_1+s_1 m_2)/(s_1 s_2)
\]
(we check that it is independent of the expressions of the elements of $S^{-1}M$ considered). On $S^{-1}A$ we further define
a multiplicative law by taking $(a_1/s_1)(a_2/s_2)=(a_1 a_2)/(s_1 s_2)$, and finally an external law on $S^{-1}M$, having
$S^{-1}A$ as a set of operators, by setting $(a/s)(m/s')=(am)/(ss')$. It is thus verified that $S^{-1}A$ is provided with a
ring structure (called \emph{the ring of fractions of} $A$, \emph{with denominators in} $S$) and $S^{-1}M$ the structure of
an $S^{-1}A$-module (called \emph{the  module of fractions of} $M$, \emph{with denominators in} $S$); for all $s\in S$,
$s/1$ is invertible in $S^{-1}A$, its inverse being $1/s$. The canonical mapping $i_A^S$ (resp. $i_M^S$) is a homomorphism
of rings (resp. a homomorphism of $A$-modules, $S^{-1}M$ being considered $A$-module by means of the homomorphism
$i_A^S:A\to S^{-1}A$).
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[1.2.3]
If $S_f=\{f^n\}_{n\geq 0}$ for a $f\in A$, we write $A_f$ and $M_f$ instead of $S_f^{-1}A$ and $S_f^{-1}M$; when $A_f$ is
considered as algebra over $A$, we can write $A_f=A[1/f]$. $A_f$ is isomorphic to the quotient algebra $A[T]/(fT-1)A[T]$.
When $f=1$, $A_f$ and $M_f$ identify canonically with $A$ and $M$; if $f$ is niipotent, $A_f$ and $M_f$ are reduced to $0$.
When $S=A-\mf{p}$, where $\mf{p}$ is a prime ideal of $A$, we write $A_\mf{p}$ and $M_\mf{p}$ instead of $S^{-1}A$ and $S^{-1}M$;
$A_\mf{p}$ is a \emph{local ring} whose maximal ideal $\mf{q}$ is generated by $i_A^S(\mf{p})$, and we have
$(i_A^S)^{-1}=\mf{p}$; by passing to the quotients, $i_A^S$ gives a monomorphism of the integral domains $A/\mf{p}$ into the
field $A_\mf{p}/\mf{q}$, which identifies with the field of fractions of $A/\mf{p}$.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}[1.2.4]
The ring of fractions $S^{-1}A$ and the canonical homomorphism $i_A^S$ are a solution of a \emph{universal mapping problem}:
any homomorphism $u$ of $A$ into a ring $B$ such that $u(S)$ is composed of \emph{invertible} elements in $B$ factorizes in
one way
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  u:A\ar[r,"i_A^S"] & S^{-1}A\ar[r,"u^\ast"] & B
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where $u^\ast$ is a ring homomorphism.
