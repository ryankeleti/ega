Let $S$, $T$ be two multiplicative subsets of a ring $A$ such that $S\su T$; there exists a canonical
homomorphism $\rho_A^{T,S}$ (or simply $\rho^{T,S}$) of $S^{-1}A$ into  $T^{-1}A$, sending the
element denoted $a/s$ of $S^{-1}A$ to the element denoted $a/s$ in $T^{-1}A$; we have
${i_A^T=\rho_A^{T,S}\circ i_A^S}$. For every $A$-module $M$, there exists in the same way an
$S^{-1}A$-linear map of $S^{-1}M$ into $T^{-1}M$ (the latter considered as an $S^{-1}A$-module thanks
to the homomorphism $\rho_A^{T,S}$), which matches the element $m/s$ of $S^{-1}M$ to the element $m/s$
of $T^{-1}M$; we note that the map $\rho_M^{T,S}$, or simply $\rho^{T,S}$, and we still have
$i_M^T=\rho_M^{T,S}\circ i_M^S$; in canonical identification (1.2.5), $\rho_M^{T,S}$ identifies with
$\rho_A^{T,S}\otimes 1$. The homomorphism $\rho_M^{T,S}$ is a \emph{functorial morphism} (or natural
transformation) of the functor $S^{-1}M$ into the functor $T^{-1}M$, in other words, the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  S^{-1}M\ar[r,"S^{-1}u"]\ar[d,"\rho_M^{T,S}"'] & S^{-1}N\ar[d,"\rho_N^{T,S}"]\\
  T^{-1}M\ar[r,"T^{-1}u"] & T^{-1}N
\end{tikzcd}\]
\oldpage{16}is commutative, for every homomorphism $u:M\to N$; $T^{-1}u$ is entirely determined by
$S^{-1}u$, because for $m\in M$ and $t\in T$, we have
\[
  (T^{-1}u)(m/t)=(t/1)^{-1}\rho^{T,S}((S^{-1}u)(m/1)).
\]
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{1.4.2}
With the same notation, for two $A$-modules $M$, $N$, the diagrams (cf. (1.3.4) and (1.3.5))
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  (S^{-1}M)\otimes_{S^{-1}A}(S^{-1}N)\ar[r,"\sim"]\ar[d] & S^{-1}(M\otimes_A N)\ar[d] & &
  S^{-1}\Hom_A(M,N)\ar[r]\ar[d] &\Hom_{S^{-1}A}(S^{-1}M,S^{-1}N)\ar[d]\\
  (T^{-1}M)\otimes_{T^{-1}A}(T^{-1}N)\ar[r,"\sim"] & T^{-1}(M\otimes_A N) & &
  T^{-1}\Hom_A(M,N)\ar[r] &\Hom_{T^{-1}A}(T^{-1}M,T^{-1}N)
\end{tikzcd}\]
are commutative.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{1.4.3}
There is an important case in which the homomorphism $\rho^{T,S}$ is \emph{bijective},
we know that then every element of $T$ is divisor of an element of $S$; we then identify by
$\rho^{T,S}$ the modules $S^{-1}M$ and $T^{-1}M$. We say that $S$ is \emph{saturated} if every divisor
in $A$ of an element of $S$ is in $S$; by replacing $S$ with  the set $T$ of all the divisors of the
elements of $S$ (a set which is multiplicative and saturated), we see that we can always, if we wish,
be limited to the consideration of modules of fractions $S^{-1}M$, where $S$ is saturated.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{1.4.4}
If $S$, $T$, $U$ are three multiplicative subsets of $A$ such that $S\su T\su U$, we have
\[
  \rho^{U,S}=\rho^{U,T}\circ\rho^{T,S}.
\]
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{1.4.5}
Consider an \emph{increasing filtered family} $(S_\a)$ of multiplicative subsets of $A$
(we write $\a\leq\b$ for $S_\a\su S_\b$), and let $S$ be the multiplicative subset
$\bigcup_\a S_\a$; let us put $\rho_{\b\a}=\rho_A^{S_\b,S_\a}$ for $\a\leq\b$;
according to (1.4.4), the homomorphisms $\rho_{\b\a}$ define a ring $A'$ as the \emph{inductive limit}
of the inductive system of rings $(S_\a^{-1}A,\rho_{\b\a})$. Let $\rho_\a$ be the canonical
map $S_\a^{-1}A\to A'$, and let $\varphi_\a=\rho_A^{S,S_\a}$; as
$\varphi_\a=\varphi_\b\circ\rho_{\b\a}$ for $\a\leq\b$ according to
(1.4.4), we can uniquely define a homomorphism $\varphi:A'\to S^{-1}A$ such that the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  & S_\a^{-1}A\ar[ddl,"\rho_\a"']\ar[d,very near end,"\rho_{\b\a}"]\ar[rdd,"\varphi_\a"]\\
  & S_\b^{-1}A\ar[ld,"\rho_\b"]\ar[rd,"\varphi_\b"'] & & (\a\leq\b)\\
  A' \ar[rr,"\varphi"'] & & S^{-1}A
\end{tikzcd}\]
is commutative. In fact, $\varphi$ is an \emph{isomorphism}; it is indeed immediate by construction that
$\varphi$ is surjective. On the other hand, if $\rho_\a(a/s_\a)\in A'$ is such that
${\varphi(\rho_\a(a/s_\a))=0}$, this means that $a/s_\a=0$ in $S^{-1}A$, that is, to say that
there exists $s\in S$ such that $sa=0$; but there is a $\b\geq\a$ such that $s\in S_\b$, and
consequently, as $\rho_\a(a/s_\a)=\rho_\b(sa/ss_\a)=0$, we find that $\varphi$ is injective.
The case for an $A$-module $M$ is treated likewise, and thus we have defined canonical isomorphisms
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  \varinjlim S_\a^{-1}A\ar[r,"\sim"] & (\varinjlim S_\a)^{-1}A, & &
  \varinjlim S_\a^{-1}M\ar[r,"\sim"] & (\varinjlim S_\a)^{-1}M,
\end{tikzcd}\]
the second being \emph{functorial} in $M$.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{1.4.6}
\oldpage{17}Let $S_1$, $S_2$ be two multiplicative subsets of $A$; then $S_1 S_2$ is also a multiplicative subset
of $A$. Let us denote by $S_2'$ the canonical image of $S_2$ in the ring $S_1^{-1}A$, which is a multiplicative
subset of this ring. For every $A$-module $M$ there is then a functorial isomorphism
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  {S_2'}^{-1}(S_1^{-1}M)\ar[r,"\sim"] & (S_1 S_2)^{-1}M
\end{tikzcd}\]
which maps $(m/s_1)/(s_2/1)$ to the element $m/(s_1 s_2)$.
\end{cx}
