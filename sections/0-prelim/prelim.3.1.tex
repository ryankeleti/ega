Let $\K$ be a category, $(A_\a)_{\a\in I}$,
$(A_{\a\b})_{(\a,\b)\in I\times I}$ two families of objects
of $\K$ such that $A_{\b\a}=A_{\a\b}$,
$(\rho_{\a\b})_{(\a,\b)\in I\times I}$ a family of morphisms
$\rho_{\a\b}:A_\a\to A_{\a\b}$. We say that a pair formed by
an object $A$ of $\K$ and a family of morphisms $\rho_\a:A\to A_\a$ 
is a \emph{solution to the universal problem} defined by the data of the families
$(A_\a)$, $(A_{\a\b})$, and $(\rho_{\a\b})$ if, for every object $B$
of $\K$, the mapping which, at all $f\in\Hom(B,A)$ matches the
family $(\rho_\a\circ f)\in\prod_\a\Hom(B,A_\a)$ is a \emph{bijection}
of $\Hom(B,A)$ to the set of all $(f_\a)$ such that
$\rho_{\a\b}\circ f_\a=\rho_{\b\a}\circ f_\b$ for any pair of
indices $(\a,\b)$. If such a solution exists, it is unique up to an isomorphism.

We will not recall the defintion of a \emph{presheaf} $U\mapsto\F(U)$ on a
topological space $X$ with values in a category $\K$ (G, I, 1.9); we say that
such a presheaf is a \emph{sheaf with values in} $\K$ if it satifies the following
axiom:\\

(F) \emph{For any covering $(U_\a)$ of an open set $U$ of $X$ by open sets
   $U_\a$ contained in $U$, if we denote by $\rho_\a$ (resp. $\rho_{\a\b}$) the
   restriction morphism}
   \[
     \F(U)\to\F(U_\a)\quad(\text{\emph{resp. }}\F(U_\a)\to\F(U_\a\cap U_\b)),
   \]
   \oldpage{24}\emph{the pair formed by $\F(U)$ and the family $(\rho_\a)$ are a solution to
   the universal problem for $(\F(U_\a))$, $(\F(U_\a\cap U_\b))$, and $(\rho_{\a\b})$
   in} (3.1.1)\footnote{This is a special case of the more general notion of a
   \emph{projective limit} (non-filtered) (\emph{see} (T, I, 1.8) and the book in
   preparation announced in the Introduction).}.\\

Equivalently, we can say that, for each object $T$ of $\K$, the family
$U\mapsto\Hom(T,\F(U))$ is a \emph{sheaf of sets}.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{3.1.3}
Assume that $\K$ is the category defined by a ``type of structure
with morphisms" $\Sigma$, the objects of $\K$ being the sets with structures
of type $\Sigma$ and morphisms those of $\Sigma$. Suppose that the category $\K$ also satisfies
the following condition:\\

(E) If $(A,(\rho_\a))$ is a solution of a universal mapping problem \emph{in the category} $\K$
for families $(A_\a)$, $(A_{\a\b})$, $(\rho_{\a\beta})$, then it is also a solution of the
universal mapping problem for the same families \emph{in the category of sets} (that is, when we
consider $A$, $A_\a$, and $A_{\a\b}$ as sets, $\rho_\a$ and $\rho_{\a\b}$ as functions)
\footnote{It can be proved that it also means that the canonical functor $\K\to(\mathrm{Ens})$
\emph{commutes with projective limits} (not necessarily filtered).}.\\

Under these conditions, the condition (F) gives that, when considered as a presheaf
\emph{of sets}, $U\mapsto\F(U)$ is a \emph{sheaf}. In addition, for a map $u:T\to\F(U)$
to be a morphism of $\K$, it is necessary and sufficient, under (F), that each map $\rho_\a\circ u$
is a morphism $T\to\F(U_\a)$, which means that the structure of type $\Sigma$ on $\F(U)$
is the \emph{initial structure} for the morphisms $\rho_\a$ . Conversely, suppose a presheaf
$U\mapsto\F(U)$ on $X$, with values in $\K$, is a \emph{sheaf of sets} and satisfies the previous
condition; it is then clear that it satisfies (F), so it is a \emph{sheaf with values in} $\K$.
