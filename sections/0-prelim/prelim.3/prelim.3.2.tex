We will restrict to the following categories $\K$ admitting
\emph{projective limits} (generalized, that is, corresponding to not necessarily filtered preordered sets,
cf. (T, 1.8)). Let $X$ be a topological space, $\mathfrak{B}$ an open basis
for the topology of $X$. We will call a \emph{presheaf on $\mathfrak{B}$, with values in $\K$,} to be
a family of objects $\F(U)\in\K$, corresponding to each $U\in\mathfrak{B}$, and a family of morphisms
$\rho_U^V:\F(V)\to\F(U)$ defined for any pair $(U,V)$ of elements of $\mathfrak{B}$ such that $U\su V$,
\oldpage{26}with the conditions $\rho_U^U=$ identity and $\rho_U^W=\rho_U^V\circ\rho_V^W$ if $U$, $V$, $W$ in
$\mathfrak{B}$ are such that $U\su V\su W$. We can associate a \emph{presheaf with values in} $\K$ : $U\mapsto\F(U)$
in the ordinary sense, taking for all open $U$, $\F'(U)=\varprojlim\F(V)$, where $V$ runs through
the ordered set (for $\su$, \emph{not filtered} in general) of $V\in\mathfrak{B}$ sets such that $V\su U$, since
the $\F(V)$ form a projective system for the $\rho_V^W$ ($V\su W\su U$, $V\in\mathfrak{B}$, $W\in\mathfrak{B}$).
Indeed, if $U$, $U'$ are two open sets of $X$ such that $U\su U'$, we define ${\rho'}_U^{U'}$ as the
projective limit (for $V\su U$) of the canonical morphisms $\F'(U')\to\F(V)$, in other words
the unique morphism y $\F'(U')\to\F'(U)$, which, when composed with the canonical morphisms
$\F'(U)\to\F(V)$, gives the canonical morphisms $\F'(U')\to\F(V)$; the verification of
the transitivity of ${\rho'}_U^{U'}$ is then immediate. Moreover, if $U\in\mathfrak{B}$,
the canonical morphism $\F'(U)\to\F(U)$ is an isomorphism, allowing to identify these two objects
\footnote{
If $X$ is a \emph{Noetherian} space, we can still define $\F'(U)$ and show that it is a presheaf (in the
ordinary sense) when one supposes only that $\K$ admits projective limits for \emph{finite} projective systems. Indeed,
if $U$ is any open set of $X$, there is a \emph{finite} covering $(V_i)$ of $U$ formed by sets of $\mathfrak{B}$; for every
couple $(i,j)$ of indices, let $(V_{ijk})$ be a finite covering of $V_i\cap V_j$ formed by sets of $\mathfrak{B}$. Let $I$ be the set
of $i$ and triples $(i,j,k)$, ordered only by the relations $i>(i,j,k)$, $j>(i,j,k)$; we then take $\F'(U)$ to be
the projective limit of the system of $\F(V_i)$ and $\F(V_{ijk})$; it is easy to verify that this does not depend on the
coverings $(V_i)$ and $(V_{ijk})$ and that $U\mapsto\F'(U)$ is a presheaf.}.
