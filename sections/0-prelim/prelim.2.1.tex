\oldpage{21}We say that a topological space $X$ is \emph{irreducible} if it is nonempty and
if it is not a union of two distinct closed subspaces of $X$. It is the same to say
that $X\neq\emp$ and that the intersection of two nonempty open sets (and consequently
of a finite number of open sets) of $X$ is nonempty, or that every nonempty open set
is everywhere dense, or that any closed subset is \unsure{\emph{rare}}, or finally
that all open sets of $X$ are \emph{connected}.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{2.1.2}
For a subspace $Y$ of a topological spave $X$ to be irreducible, it is necessary and
sufficient that its closure $\overline{Y}$ be irreducible. In particular, any subspace
which is the closure $\overline{\{x\}}$ of a reduced subspace to a point is irreducible;
we will express the relation $y\in\overline{\{x\}}$ (equivalent to
$\overline{\{y\}}\su\overline{\{x\}}$) by saying that there is a \emph{specialization of}
$x$ or that there is a \emph{generalization of} $y$. When there exists in an irreducible
space $X$ a point $x$ such that $X=\overline{\{x\}}$, we will say that $x$ is a
\emph{generic point} of $X$. Any nonempty open subset of $X$ then contains $x$, and any
subspace containing $x$ admits $x$ for a generic point.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{2.1.3}
Recall that a \emph{Kolmogoroff space} is a topological space $X$ satisfying the axiom
of separation:

$(T_0)$ If $x\neq y$ are any two points of $X$, there is an open set containing one of
the points $x$, $y$ and not the other.

If an irreducible Kolmogoroff space admits a generic point, it admits \emph{only} one
since a nonempty open set contains any generic point.

Recall that a topological space $X$ is said to be \emph{quasi-compact} if, from any
collection of open sets of $X$, one can extract a finite cover of $X$ (or, equivalently,
if any decreasing filter family of nonempty closed sets has a nonempty intersection). If
$X$ is a quasi-compact space, then any nonempty closed subset $A$ of $X$ contains a \emph{minimal}
nonempty closed set $M$, because the set of nonempty closed subsets of $A$ is inductive for
the relation $\supset$; if in addition $X$ is a Kolmogoroff space, $M$ is necessarily reduced
to a single point (or, as we say by abuse of language, is a \emph{closed point}).
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{2.1.4}
In an irreducible space $X$, every nonempty open subspace $U$ is irreducible, and if $X$
admits a generic point $x$, $x$ is also a generic point of $U$.

Let $(U_\alpha)$ be a cover (whose set of indices is nonempty) of a topological space $X$,
consisting of nonempty open sets; if $X$ is irreducible, it is necessary and sufficient that
$U_\alpha$ is irreducible for all $\alpha$, and that $U_\alpha\cap U_\beta\neq\emp$ for any
$\alpha$, $\beta$. The condition is clearly necessary; to the that it is sufficient, it suffices
to prove that if $V$ is a nonempty open subset of $X$, then $V\cap U_\alpha$ is nonempty for all
$\alpha$, since then $V\cap U_\alpha$ is dense in $U_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$, and consequently
$V$ is dense in $X$. Now there is at least one index $\gamma$ such that $V\cap U_\gamma\neq\emp$,
so $V\cap U_\gamma$ is dense in $U_\gamma$, and as for all $\alpha$, $U_\alpha\cap V_\alpha\neq\emp$,
we also have $V\cap U_\alpha\cap U_\gamma\neq\emp$.
\end{cx}

\begin{cx}{2.1.5}
\oldpage{22}Let $X$ be an irreducible space, $f$ a continuous map of $X$ into a topological space $Y$.
Then $f(X)$ is irreducible, and if $x$ is a generic point of $X$, $f(x)$ is a generic point of
$f(X)$ and hence also of $\overline{f(X)}$. In particular, if in addition $Y$ is irreducible and
with a single generic point $y$, for $f(X)$ to be everywhere dense, it is necessary and sufficient
that $f(x)=y$.
