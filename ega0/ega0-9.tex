\begin{defn}[9.1.1]
\label{0.9.1.1}
We say that a continuous map $f:X\to Y$ is \emph{quasi-compact} if for every quasi-compact open subset $U$ of $Y$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is quasi-compact.
We say that a subset $Z$ of a topological space $X$ is \emph{retrocompact} in $X$ if the canonical injection $Z\to X$ is quasi-compact, in other words, if for every quasi-compact open subset $U$ of $X$, $U\cap Z$ is quasi-compact.
\end{defn}

A \emph{closed} subset of $X$ is retrocompact in $X$, but a quasi-compact subset of $X$ is not necessarily retrocompact in $X$.
If $X$ is quasi-compact, every retrocompact open subset of $X$ is quasi-compact.
It is clear that every \emph{finite} union of retrocompact sets in $X$ is retrocompact in $X$, as every finite union of quasi-compact sets is quasi-compact.
Every finite intersection of retrocompact open sets in $X$ is a retrocompact open set in $X$.
In a \emph{locally Noetherian} space $X$, every quasi-compact set is a Noetherian subspace, and as a result \emph{every subset} of $X$ is retrocompact in $X$.

\begin{defn}[9.1.2]
\label{0.9.1.2}
Given a topological space $X$, we say that a subset of $X$ is \emph{constructible} if it belongs to the smallest set of subsets $\fk{F}$ of $X$ containing all the retrocompact open subsets of $\fk{F}$ and is stable under finite intersections and complements (which implies that $\fk{F}$ is also stable under finite unions).
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}[9.1.3]
\label{0.9.1.3}
For a subset of $X$ to be constructible, it is necessary and sufficient for it to be a finite union of sets of the form $U\cap\complement{V}$, where $U$ and $V$ are retrocompact open sets in $X$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-0.9.1.3}
It is clear that the condition is sufficient.
To see that it is necessary, consider the set $\fk{G}$ of finite unions of sets of the form $U\cap\complement{V}$, where $U$ and $V$ are retrocompact open sets in $X$; it suffices to see that every complement of a set in $\fk{G}$ is in $\fk{G}$.
Let $Z=\bigcup_{i\in I}(U_i\cap\complement{V_i})$, where $I$ is finite, $U_i$ and $V_i$ retrocompact open sets in $X$; we have
$\complement{Z}=\bigcap_{i\in I}(V_i\cup\complement{U_i})$, so $Z$ is a finite union of sets which are intersections of a certain number of the $V_i$ and of a certain number of the $\complement{U_i}$, thus of the form
\oldpage[0\textsubscript{III}]{13}
$V\cap\complement{U}$, where $U$ is the union of a certain number of the $U_i$ and $V$ is the intersection of a certain number of the $V_i$; but we have noted above that finite unions and intersections of retrocompact open sets in $X$ are retrocompact open sets in $X$, hence the conclusion.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[9.1.4]
\label{0.9.1.4}
Every constructible subset of $X$ is retrocompact in $X$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-0.9.1.4}
It suffices to show that if $U$ and $V$ are retrocompact open sets in $X$, then $U\cap\complement{V}$ is retrocompact in $X$; if $W$ is a quasi-compact open set in $X$, then $W\cap U\cap\complement{V}$ is closed in the quasi-compact space $W\cap U$, hence it is quasi-compact.
\end{proof}

In particular:
\begin{cor}[9.1.5]
\label{0.9.1.5}
For an open subset $U$ of $X$ to be constructible, it is necessary and sufficient for it to be retrocompact in $X$.
For a closed subset $F$ of $X$ to be constructible, it is necessary and sufficient for the open set $\complement{F}$ to be retrocompact.
\end{cor}

\begin{env}[9.1.6]
\label{0.9.1.6}
An important case is when every quasi-compact open subset of $X$ is retrocompact, in other words, when the intersection of two quasi-compact open subsets of $X$ is quasi-compact (cf.~\sref[I]{1.5.5.6}).
When $X$ is also quasi-compact, this implies that the retrocompact open subsets of $X$ are identical to the quasi-compact open subsets of $X$, and the constructible subsets of $X$ are finite unions of sets of the form $U\cap\complement{V}$, where $U$ and $V$ are quasi-compact open sets.
\end{env}

\begin{cor}[9.1.7]
\label{0.9.1.7}
For a subset of a Noetherian space to be constructible, it is necessary and sufficient for it to be a finite union of locally closed subsets of $X$.
\end{cor}

\begin{prop}[9.1.8]
\label{0.9.1.8}
Let $X$ be a topological space, $U$ an open subset of $X$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{(\roman*)}]
  \item If $T$ is a constructible subset of $X$, then $T\cap U$ is a constructible subset of $U$.
  \item In addition, suppose that $U$ is retrocompact in $X$. For a subset $Z$ of $U$ to be constructible in $X$, it is necessary and sufficient for it to be constructible in $U$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-0.9.1.8}
\medskip\noindent
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item Using Proposition \sref{0.9.1.3}, we reduce to showing that if $T$ is a retrocompact open set in $X$, then $T\cap U$ is a retrocompact open set in $U$, in other words, for every quasi-compact open $W\subset U$, $T\cap U\cap W=T\cap W$ is quasi-compact, which immediately follows from the hypothesis.
  \item The condition is necessary by (i), so it remains to show that it is sufficient.
    By Proposition \sref{0.9.1.3}, it suffices to consider the case where $Z$ is a retrocompact open set \emph{in $U$}, because it will then follow that $U-Z$ is constructible in $X$, and if $Z$ and $Z'$ are two retrocompact opens \emph{in $U$}, then $Z\cap(U-Z')$ will be constructible in $X$.
    If $W$ is a quasi-compact open set in $X$ and $Z$ a retrocompact open set in $U$, then we have $Z\cap W=Z\cap(W\cap U)$, and by hypothesis $W\cap U$ is a quasi-compact open set in $U$; so $W\cap Z$ is quasi-compact, and as a result $Z$ is a retrocompact open set in $X$, and \emph{a fortiori} constructible in $X$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[9.1.9]
\label{0.9.1.9}
Let $X$ be a topological space, $(U_i)_{i\in I}$ a finite cover of $X$ by retrocompact open sets in $X$.
For a subset $Z$ of $X$ to be constructible in $X$, it is necessary and sufficient for $Z\cap U_i$ to be constructible in $U_i$ for all $i\in I$.
\end{cor}

\begin{env}[9.1.10]
\label{0.9.1.10}
In particular, suppose that $X$ is quasi-compact and every point
\oldpage[0\textsubscript{III}]{14}
of $X$ admits a fundamental system of retrocompact open neighborhoods in $X$ (and \emph{a fortiori} quasi-compact); then the condition for a subset $Z$ of $X$ to be constructible in $X$ is of a \emph{local} nature, in other words, it is necessary and sufficient that for evert $x\in X$, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that $V\cap Z$ is constructible in $V$.
Indeed, if this condition is satisfied, then there exists for every $x\in X$ an open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ which is \emph{retrocompact in $X$} and such that $V\cap Z$ is constructible in $V$, by the hypotheses on $X$ and by Proposition \sref{0.9.1.8}[i]; it then suffices to cover $X$ by a finite number of these neighborhoods and to apply Corollary \sref{0.9.1.9}.
\end{env}

\begin{defn}[9.1.11]
\label{0.9.1.11}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
We say that a subset $T$ of $X$ is \emph{locally constructible} in $X$ if for every $x\in X$ there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that $T\cap V$ is constructible in $V$.
\end{defn}

It follows from Proposition \sref{0.9.1.8}[i] that if $V$ is such that $V\cap T$ is constructible in $V$, then for every open $W\subset V$, $W\cap T$ is constructible in $W$.
If $T$ is locally constructible in $X$, then for every open set $U$ in $X$, $T\cap U$ is locally constructible in $U$, as a result of the above remark.
The same remark shows that the set of locally constructible subsets of $X$ is stable under finite unions and finite intersections; on ther other hand, it is clear that it is also stabble under taking complements.

\begin{prop}[9.1.12]
\label{0.9.1.12}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Every constructible set in $X$ is locally constructible in $X$.
The converse is true if $X$ is quasi-compact and if its topology admits a basis formed by the retrocompact sets in $X$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-0.9.1.12}
The first assertion follows from Definition \sref{0.9.1.11} and the second from \sref{0.9.1.10}.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[9.1.13]
\label{0.9.1.13}
Let $X$ be a topological space whose topology admits a basis formed by the retrocompact sets in $X$.
Then every locally constructible subset $T$ of $X$ is retrocompact in $X$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-0.9.1.13}
Let $U$ be a quasi-compact open set in $X$; $T\cap U$ is locally constructible in $U$, hence constructible in $U$ by Proposition \sref{0.9.1.12}, and as a result quasi-compact by Corollary \sref{0.9.1.4}.
\end{proof}
