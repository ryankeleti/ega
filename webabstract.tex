\textbf{What this is.}
    This is a community translation of Grothendieck's EGA I.
    As it is a work in progress by multiple people, it will probably have a few
    mistakes --- if you spot any then please feel free to
    \href{https://github.com/ryankeleti/en.ega.i/issues}{let us know}!
    \thanks{\url{https://github.com/ryankeleti/en.ega.i}}

\noindent
    \textbf{Note.} EGA uses `prescheme' for what is now usually called
    a scheme, and `scheme' for what is now usually called a
    separated scheme.
